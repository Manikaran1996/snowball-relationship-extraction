Nabard official <PER>Mayur Bora</PER> said one of the reasons why farmers were not benefiting from <MISC>insurance instruments</MISC> was that most of them were written in English. As most farmers do not know the English language, it is necessary to translate all the products into the regional language and distribute leaflets and pamphlets among them so that they can become aware and approach the <ORG>regional crop insurance office</ORG> in Guwahati to get their crops insured, <PER>he</PER> added. <PER>Nivedita Deka</PER>, <MISC>professor</MISC> of the <ORG>department</ORG> of agricultural economics and farm management, said the AAUs extension <ORG>education department</ORG> would soon start working on this. <PER>S.S.

Another resource person, <PER>K.M.

Out of four power generation units at <PER>Guru Nanak</PER> thermal plant in Bathinda, transformers of units 1 and 2 were burned last week. Unit 3 of the thermal plant has already been lying closed for over a year for renovation, so only unit 4 of the thermal plant is functional. With burning of two transformers, total power generation loss in <ORG>Punjab</ORG> is around 50 lakh units every day.Though the state power corporation has summoned a team of engineers from <ORG>Bharat Heavy</ORG> Electrical Ltd, <LOC>Jhansi</LOC>, <STA>Uttar Pradesh</STA>, to rectify the faults in transformers, there is little hope for rectification of faults in the burned transformers, which are already 37 years old.

Kastauri Lal, <MISC>chief engineer</MISC>, <PER>Guru Nanak</PER> thermal plant, said <ORG>BHEL</ORG> engineers are expected to rectify the fault within the next 10 days. Technical staff in the thermal plant said transformers had outlived their utility. Besides causing huge power loss, burning of transformers will increase the financial burden on the state power corporation to increase its power purchasing targets from other states, said sources.In keeping with the wishes of the ruling party in <ORG>Punjab</ORG>, the state power corporation has already reportedly set a target- to spend over Rs 5,500 crore on purchase of power from other states. With burning of transformers, the burden on the power corporation has increased as the cotton cultivation season has already started and paddy plantation time is fast approaching. With the temperature increasing, power consumption is thus registering a steep rise. The corporation <MISC>chief managing directo<MISC>r</MISC> KD Chaudhary</MISC> said the power supply to the domestic connections in the state would be uninterrupted as <ORG>Punjab</ORG> had already signed power purchase agreements with various sources to import <MISC>electricity</MISC> from other states.

42,Corporate Professionals,['Delhi'],['CORPORATE PROFESSIONALS SECRETARIAL SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED'],"['<LOC>MUMBAI</LOC>: Market regulator Sebi on Friday released a consultative paper on corporate governance which proposes splitting of the post of <MISC>chairman-cum-managing director</MISC>, giving greater responsibilities and powers to independent directors. The regulator also pitched for aligning rules relating to listed entities along with the proposed Companies Bill that is awaiting Parliament\'s approval.Among a slew of other proposals, the paper suggested that the appointment of independent directors should be only by minority shareholders, such directors should be formally trained to be on company boards and they should also be regularly evaluated for their performance. The regulator has proposed separating the CMD position in a company mainly to avoid concentration of power with one person. This may lead to changes in the structure of a large number of Indian companies, mainly PSU and family-owned firms, where one person holds the position of <MISC>chairman-cum-managing director</MISC> (CMD), market players said.Interestingly, the regulator also suggested that all independent directors should go through a compulsory training session, followed by an exam, both under <ORG><MISC>National Institute of Securities M</ORG>arkets</MISC> (<ORG>NISM</ORG>), a training body under Sebi. However, it has not stipulated any exemptions even for reputed independent directors in the country, who, with years of experience and a solid track record, may not be willing to take such tests, <MISC>a corporate lawyer</MISC> pointed out.Sebi is also aiming to change Clause 49 of the listing agreement between companies and stock exchanges to align it with the proposed Companies Bill. Listing agreement deals with the rules that all listed companies should adhere to remain listed on the bourses. These rules, although aimed at making the Indian market a safer place in terms of corporate governance, could lead to shortage of good independent directors since remunerations for these people may not commensurate with the duties and responsibilities, practitioners in the corporate field said.Sebi\'s paper proposed that all independent directors should be appointed by minority shareholders only and also suggested that there could be proportional or cumulative voting while electing such directors. In <MISC>India</MISC>, proportional voting is done while electing <MISC>the President</MISC>. It also proposed the position of <MISC>a lead independent director</MISC> in each company.Sebi also proposed that while resigning, <MISC>an independent director</MISC> should disclose the reasons for his/her decision. ""It has been suggested that the reason for the resignation of <MISC>the independent director</MISC> should be submitted to the Board of the company which in turn should circulate the same to shareholders and inform the stock exchange in this regard,"" the Sebi paper said.Although professionals from the corporate advisory field lauded Sebi\'s moves to adopt global best practices, they feel some of the proposals are too stringent, and the issue about remuneration packages for the directors should also be looked into. ""The rules will better the corporate governance process in the country, but they look too stringent,"" said <PER>Pavan Kumar Viajy, MD</PER>, <ORG>Corporate Professionals</ORG>, a <LOC>Delhi</LOC>-based corporate legal and financial advisory firm. ""Also, Sebi should be clear about the remuneration package for such directors.

Majority of the investment proposals even got the cabinet nod four years ago but it has not made much headway till date. Though some of the small projects, barring exceptional big industrial projects, have been actualised on the ground but umpteen projects are stuck in limbo. Some of the industrial projects which have successfully been established in the state over the past five years are a tractor factory by Sonalika Tractors at Fatuha, <ORG>GISCO</ORG>, a <MISC>steel company</MISC>, at Bihta, makhana producing <MISC>Sudha Shakti factory</MISC> all in <LOC>Patna</LOC>, HLLs franchisees detergent power manufacturing unit at Hajipur among others. The state governments website showed that the major bottlenecks, which the state has received, are in the filed of power plants and sugar factory for ethanol production. There are more than two dozen proposals for setting up sugarcane-based ethanol manufacturing units, which would have brought massive investment to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore apart from creating thousands of employment opportunities. However, the Centre brought amendments in the sugarcane control order, saying that sugar factories cannot produce ethanol directly from sugarcane thus jeopardising the prospect of Rs 20,000 crore investment in this field alone. Some of the companies, which are keen to make investments for setting up ethanol factories are <ORG>Rajshree Sugars</ORG> and <ORG>Chemical Limited</ORG>, <LOC>Coimbatore</LOC>, <ORG>Dhampur Sugar Mills</ORG>, <LOC>Delhi</LOC>, <ORG><ORG>Indian Gasohol Li</ORG>mited</ORG>, <STA>Tamil Nadu</STA>, <ORG>Kamlapur</ORG> and <ORG>Industries Limited</ORG>, <LOC>Calcutta</LOC>.

57,Fortis Group,['Delhi'],['FORTIS HOSPITALS LIMITED'],"[""It is all very well to talk from a pedestal on how it is essential to eat healthy and have a decent level of exercise. But how do you convince children to actually fashion their lifestyle to facilitate a healthy life, tortured as they are by choices and temptations.It is very difficult to do, admits <PER>Anoop Mishra</PER>, <MISC>Director and Head</MISC>, <ORG>Department of Diabetes</ORG> and <MISC>Metabolic Diseases</MISC>, <ORG>Fortis Group</ORG> of Hospitals, in <LOC>Delhi</LOC>. <PER>He</PER> leads the DISHAA programme to sensitise schoolchildren, their parents, teachers, and general public to healthy living. It also focussed on primary <MISC>prevention of <MISC>o</MISC>besity</MISC> and inculcation of healthy diet and lifestyle practices.In a six-month study we did, we could show that intervening among children has the desired effect, of lowering weight, blood sugar levels and other factors, <PER>Dr. Mishra</PER> explains. But, for that we need dedicated counsellors working with the children every week. To find that dedication is difficult, also parents, and teachers do not consider this a priority issue. It can be done, <PER>he</PER> assures, but one needs to find the dedication, the time, and people with the requisite skills. Lecturing to children will scarcely have any effect, according to <PER>him</PER>.Since then, the DISHAA project has been launching interventions countrywide. Over 70 cities and over 80 diabetologists and physicians have been instructed to intervene in various schools. It is true, not all have succeeded, but about half of them have been working in schools. And we do have a clear idea as to how the programme must be taken ahead to bring a true change, <PER>he</PER> adds .Closer home, in Chennai, another pilot effort has been ongoing to try and change the behaviour of children again in schools. The <MISC><ORG>M.V. Hos</MISC>pital for Diabetes</ORG>, as a follow up to a study to measure <MISC>obesity</MISC> and the impact of socio economic factors, has taken up intervention in schools, its <MISC>managing director</MISC>, <PER>Vijay Viswanathan</PER> says.The study examined the weight of over 1,100 children between grades four and 10, to estimate whether they were obese, overweight, or normal. It showed that 12.1 per cent among the children were overweight and the same figure for adolescents was 15.5 per cent. The intervention programme was rolled out about six months ago, and tried to look at whether implementing the <ORG>Central Board of Secondary Education</ORG>'s health manual in schools will have a beneficial effect. The manual is very, very comprehensive, was developed by the <ORG>CBSE</ORG> along with a team of medical, nutrition, and education experts. If all schools follow this and implement it, it will definitely result in bringing down the <MISC>obesity</MISC> rates, <PER>Dr. Viswanathan</PER> states. It covers everything, including provisions for preventing <MISC>obesity</MISC> and improving lifestyle, monitoring what must be served in the canteen, what children bring for lunch and snacks, <PER>he</PER> explains.However, the manual, drawn up in collaboration with the <ORG>WHO</ORG>, a few years ago, was implemented by very few schools. Three manuals are available for different grades. We found that schools needed a little more inputs on the subject and a little help with implementation, <PER>he</PER> said. That is how 10 <ORG>CBSE</ORG> schools in the city came to be involved in the intervention programme, each sending teachers for training in implementing the manual for children of different ages.At the end of an initial evaluation in two schools where the project was implemented, there were definite pluses, <PER>Dr. Viswanathan</PER> adds, indicating satisfactory implementation. The kids' knowledge on lifestyle factors and health, their height, weight, waist and hip circumference have been measured initially and will be contrasted after implementation of the programme. A control group of 10 schools without as much intensive intervention would also be measured in comparison.If we can show that this manual works, then it would be perfect to be adapted to the other boards of education, across the States. Thereby, we will go a long way in influencing the lifestyle choices of the future generations, <PER>he</PER> says.""]"

85,IDFC Securities,['Mumbai'],['IDFC SECURITIES LIMITED'],"['<LOC>MUMBAI</LOC>: The Indian FMCG sector has witnessed one of its biggest top-level churns over the last few months as a new set of leaders takes charge in a fiercely competitive industry.

Having clocked impressive growth numbers over the past year, signs of consumers cutting back on spends are beginning to show, making it interesting to watch how this new leadership braces up to these challenges.On Friday <PER>Hindustan Unilev<ORG>er</PER></ORG> joined the long list of FMCG majors which will see a new face at the top. <ORG>Unilever</ORG> veteran <PER>Sanjiv Mehta</PER> is set to take over as the <MISC>India</MISC> unit\'s <MISC>CEO</MISC>.The 53-year-old will take over from <PER>Nitin Paranjpe</PER>, who has been elevated to a new global role. Industry experts say these changes at the top are indicative of one cycle of leadership tenure coming to an end. Most of the outgoing leaders have been heading these companies for more than five years, with the exception of <ORG>PepsiCo</ORG>\'s Manu Anand.However, the lack of younger faces being chosen to drive the next phase of growth in a strong emerging market like <MISC>India</MISC> is conspicuous, says K <PER>Sudarshan</PER>, <MISC>head</MISC> of <ORG>EMA Partners</ORG>, a global executive <MISC>search firm</MISC>. ""We still do not see the next generation of leaders in the FMCG sector coming up on top despite the industry being one of the most mature in terms of talent. This shows at some level people have stagnated and one 50-year-old is being replaced by another. Maybe to some extent the companies have missed the opportunity as they played safe,"" <PER>Sudarshan</PER> says.By appointing leaders in their 50s, companies also run the risk of saturating the talent pipeline as the pyramid becomes top heavy. ""The rejig has happened because of different reasons. In some domestic companies, new leadership replaced old hands, who neared retirement and in some multinational firms, there has been an internal reorganization,"" said <PER>Nikhil Vora, MD</PER>, <ORG>IDFC Securities</ORG>, a <LOC>Mumbai</LOC>-based broking firm. This frenetic people movement may also bring back the zing in the sector, say headhunters. FMCG has historically been one of the most coveted industries among MBA graduates; however, <MISC>investment banking</MISC>, <MISC>financial services</MISC> and technology & telecoms took away some amount of sheen from the industry in the last decade or so. ""The gap between FMCG and other sectors narrowed over the years but still it is one industry which makes executives come close to consumers like no other industry can. This is a huge advantage for the sector,"" said <PER>Ronesh Puri, MD</PER> at Executive Access.The Rs 1,80,000-crore sector, said industry experts, is facing near-term challenges with respect to slowing growth and inflation and for the new leaders the test will lie in how well they devise ways to counter these issues.']"

Citizen representatives implored the <ORG>KERC</ORG> to first analyse the requirement of hike proposedby the KPTCL and <MISC>electricity supply companies</MISC>. While urban consumers flagged technical deficiencies in the system, rural consumers were the unhappiest. They sought an audit into the claim by <ORG><ORG>Bangalore Electricity Supply Co</ORG>mpany (Bescom)</ORG> of supplying six hours of power and 11 hours in single phaseto rural areas.While IT bigwigs like <ORG>Infosys</ORG> and <ORG>Wipro</ORG> made a case for <MISC>cheaper green energy</MISC> and end to cross subsidy, hospitals pleaded not to be bracketed with entertainment sector. The Metro authorities sought a freeze on hike until their project was over.Seeking previous audits to be made available in public domain, consumers said this would check the claims made by power companies. ""Consumers can see whether the actual figures and predictions are scalable or fictitious,"" said A <PER>Raja Rao</PER>, member of <ORG>Consumer Care Society</ORG>. He said while <ORG>Bescom</ORG> had improved in complaint redressal via <MISC>telecom services</MISC>, these were curative measures. ""Power trips happen almost in every corner of the city for 10-15 minutes and is not a result of load shedding but some nut going loose or wire sagging off which are technical deficiencies,"" he said.Lambasting the power suppky. Lakshmikanth BL from Kunigal village in <STA>Tumkur district</STA> said, ""One can\'t get help easily at hand as in the city,"" he said.Industrial associations from Malur and Tumkur complained they get only four hours of power supply while their city counterparts get more. <ORG><ORG>Peenya Industrial Associ</ORG>ation</ORG> member Mallappa Gowda said, ""The government and <ORG>BESCOM</ORG> claim to regularize six lakh illegal irrigational pump sets but the number could be far more and there is no count. Until all are regularized, how can the <ORG>BESCOM</ORG> promise to give us more power. Moreover recession has affected middle, small and even big industries for more than three years and there is a negative growth. Tariff hike will over burden us to run the show.""Poultry and farm houses asked why they have to pay the same as the city dweller for just five hours of supply a day.Representatives of <ORG>Wipro</ORG> and <ORG>Infosys</ORG> pleaded with the <ORG>KERC</ORG> to make <MISC>green energy</MISC> cheaper. They also pleaded against cross subsidy, with poor consumers paying less while the industrial and commercial consumers paying more for a specified quantum of power per unit. <ORG>Manipal Group</ORG> sought withdrawal of cross subsidy.Make previous audits of power cos public to check if actual figures and predictions are scalable or fictitious. | <PER>Raja Rao</PER>, member, Consumer Care SocietyWhat\'s the point in regularizing irrigation pump sets when there is no power? | Lakshmikanth BL, Kunigal village, TumkurRecession has hit industries for over three years.

""Over 5,000 private hospitals associated with AHPI have charity offerings for poor patients below poverty level and are entitled to various schemes under the state governments,"" <PER>he</PER> said.On an average private hospitals pay Rs450-480 on <MISC>electricity</MISC> per bed per day, <PER>he</PER> said. The operation costs for them are far too less than for other patients and the hospital managements bear the infrastructural costs. <ORG>KERC</ORG> asked AHPI to look into <MISC>energy conservation</MISC> of <MISC>energy</MISC> in large private hospitals.""We pay Rs 7.20 per unit for power under entertainment industries section. We want to come under HT 2 (A) industries and pay Rs 5.5 per unit,""<PER>Dr Devi Shetty</PER>, <MISC>cardiac surgeon, said</MISC>.The hike was tantamount to penalizing them for buying green power, said representatives of IT companies. The generators of green power gives them a discount of about five percent and bear the cross subsidy component in the tariff, they said.

Instead, <PER>Wegielewski</PER>, 29, found a job close to home in an industry that has become one of the largest employers in <MISC>Poland</MISC>: outsourcing. <PER>He</PER> is <MISC>a project leader</MISC> in data and system analysis for <ORG>Infosys</ORG>, the Indian outsourcing giant with a big office here that serves clients in <LOC>Amsterdam</LOC>, <LOC>London</LOC> and <LOC>New York</LOC>, among other business capitals. <ORG>Infosys</ORG>, based in <LOC>Bangalore</LOC>, has its largest site outside <MISC>India</MISC> here. About 2,000 people work in a new office building overlooking a traffic circle named for <ORG>Solidarity</ORG>, the trade union movement that led <MISC>Poland</MISC> out of communism. A lot of my colleagues left, <PER>Wegielewski</PER> said in English. I wanted to stay. In fact, <LOC>Lodz</LOC>, a former <MISC>textile manufacturing centre</MISC> with a population of about 740,000, is just one of several Polish cities that have become service hubs for an international corporate clientele that values Polands well-educated and often multilingual work force. In midsize cities like Wroclaw and Gdansk, Poles are doing back-office work not only for Indian outsourcing companies like <ORG>Infosys</ORG>, <ORG>Wipro</ORG> and <ORG>Tata Consultancy Services</ORG>, but also for major corporations like <ORG>IBM</ORG> and banks including <ORG>Citigroup</ORG> and <ORG>Bank of New York Mellon</ORG>. About 110,000 people work in what is broadly known as the business services industry in <MISC>Poland</MISC>. The category includes outsourcers like <ORG>Infosys</ORG> that take over such functions as <MISC>finance</MISC> or <MISC><MISC>information tech</MISC>nology</MISC> for customers, as well as banks and other companies that set up in-house operations to do their own back-office work. At current growth rates, it is conceivable that in a few <MISC>years business services</MISC> in <MISC>Poland</MISC> could overtake the auto industry, which employs about 140,000 people, as a leading source of private sector jobs. Business services are part of the explanation for Polands steady economic growth in recent years, even amid stagnancy in the 17-nation euro zone, the countrys largest market. Part of Polands edge derives from the fact that it has yet to join the euro currency union. Its currency, the zloty, has been relatively stable against the worlds reserve currencies in the last year. But Polands enviable perch is nonetheless precarious. It faces rising competition from other countries in <MISC><MISC>Eastern </MISC>Europe</MISC>, like <MISC>Bulgaria</MISC> and <MISC>Romania</MISC>, and educated enclaves elsewhere, like <MISC>Spain</MISC>. That is why industry specialists say <MISC>Poland</MISC> must move into more sophisticated services, like research and development, to continue attracting investment and corporate clients. <PER>Wegielewski</PER> may represent the sort of Pole more than ready to head higher. <PER>He</PER> has masters degrees from the <MISC><ORG>University of</MISC> Lodz</ORG> in management and in econometrics, a hybrid of economics and math. That makes <PER>him</PER> well suited to oversee a team that provides services to the retailing industry. <PER>He</PER> is studying part time for a third degree, in philosophy, which could prove useful in tackling difficult intellectual problems but is just a hobby, <PER>he</PER> said. In <MISC>Poland</MISC>, 39 per cent of people 25 to 34 years old have university degrees or the equivalent. This puts the country in second place behind <MISC>Norway</MISC> in that category among the nearly three dozen member countries of the <ORG>Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</ORG>. Polands well-regarded universities have been willing to modify their curriculum to produce graduates with the skills sought by companies like <ORG>Infosys</ORG>. There is a strong correlation between education and the success of <MISC>Poland</MISC>, said <PER>Anurag Srivastava</PER>, a <LOC>New Delhi</LOC>-based <MISC>practice director</MISC> at the <ORG>Everest Group</ORG>, which advises corporate clients on managing outsourcing and back-office operations. <LOC>Lodz</LOC>, where unemployment is 13.7 per cent, is still recovering from the collapse of the textile industry after the fall of communism and seems caught between two eras. A complex of brick buildings that was once part of the fabric industry has been converted into a <MISC>hip hotel</MISC> and shopping mall filled with French and German <MISC>retail-chain outlets</MISC>. But much of the city still has the drab, crumbling ambience of <MISC><MISC>Eastern </MISC>Europe</MISC> in communist times. Labour costs in <MISC>Poland</MISC> for people with the skills needed for business services are about half those of <MISC><MISC>Western </MISC>Europe</MISC>, though still roughly double those in <MISC>India</MISC>. <PER>Martijn Geerling</PER>, <MISC>a senior director</MISC> in <LOC>London</LOC> for Hackett, said Polands main rivals were neighbours like <MISC>Romania</MISC> and <MISC>Bulgaria</MISC>, where wages are even lower but education levels are high. <MISC>Poland</MISC> and any country needs to understand competition is mostly with Eastern European countries, <PER>Geerling</PER> said. <ORG>Infosys</ORG> assumes that the differences in wages worldwide will shrink over time, and attracting clients will require doing work for them that is not only cheaper but better. We believe our value proposition in the long run is about the automation and transformation of the processes  not labour arbitrage, said <PER>Krystian Bestry</PER>, <MISC>head of business</MISC> outsourcing in <MISC>Europe</MISC> for <ORG>Infosys</ORG>, who is based in <LOC>Lodz</LOC>. The <MISC><ORG>Infosys</</MISC>ORG> centre in <LOC>Lodz</LOC> was established by <ORG>Philips</ORG>, the Dutch <MISC>electronics company</MISC>, to handle mainly basic back-office work like processing invoices. <ORG>Infosys</ORG> bought it from <ORG>Philips</ORG> in 2007 and shifted to more advanced projects, such as helping companies reorganise functions like <MISC>internal auditing</MISC> and tax preparation.

(PTI) <LOC>Mumbai</LOC>, Nov. 29: <ORG>The Securities and Exchange Board of India</ORG> (<ORG>Sebi</ORG>) is planning to implement a specific time frame within which companies floating an initial public offer (IPO) will have to respond to its queries. The move forms part of a complete review of the IPO process that the market regulator is undertaking. <ORG>Sebi</ORG> has set up a group in this regard and it has now sought suggestions from market intermediaries and other entities. <ORG>Sebi</ORG> <MISC>chairman</MISC> U.K. <PER>Sinha</PER> said companies do not reply to queries from the market regulator when the market conditions arent good in an attempt to delay the issue. We are going to change the rules of the game. We are going to make it obligatory for companies to submit their responses to Sebis queries within a particular time frame. If they dont, the case will be closed, <PER>Sinha</PER> told delegates at the third Capital Markets Summit organised by the <ORG>Confederation of Indian Industry</ORG> (<ORG>CII</ORG>) here today. Under <ORG>Sebi</ORG> rules, a company has to come out with its public issue within 90 days after the regulator clears its prospectus. If it fails to do so, the approval lapses and the company will have to re-start the entire process. <PER>Sinha</PER> said the objective behind the complete review of the IPO process was to make fund raising by companies more efficient in terms of time and costs. But let me also alert you that in the process there will be some additional obligations on the intermediaries, <PER>he</PER> said without giving details. <PER>Uday Kotak<<ORG>/PER></ORG>, <MISC>executive vice-chairman and managing director</MISC> at <ORG>Kotak Mahindra Bank</ORG>, welcomed Sebis move to review the IPO procedures. The market regulator has in the past taken various measures to improve the entire IPO process. It has crunched the time between an IPOs close and the stock listing to 12 days. There are plans to trim this further. <ORG>Sebi</ORG> is also planning to impose a circuit filter on the listing day of a new offering. It has asked merchant bankers to reduce the size of the application form for IPOs and disclose their track record of issues managed and their performance. Meanwhile, the market regulator today ruled out banning high frequency trading or <MISC>algorithm trading products</MISC> even as it expressed concern over their faster growth and technical glitches they entailed. We will consult all the stake holders before taking a decision. Though <ORG>Sebi</ORG> has yet to come up with a risk management system for these products, we want all the players to have their <MISC>own risk management systems</MISC> in place, <PER>Sinha</PER> told reporters on the sidelines of the <ORG>CII</ORG> meeting. Algorithmic trading, or the high frequency trading system, uses highly advanced mathematical models to make transaction decisions. This highly quantitative trading model employs computerised algorithms to analyse the incoming market data and implement proprietary trading strategies wherein large quantities of shares are purchased by dividing them into smaller lots and allowing the complex algorithms to decide when the smaller blocks should be purchased.']"

With the aid of pilotless target aircraft, Lakshya, the Akash missile successfully intercepted a flying target. Senior officials from the defence ministry said Friday\'s test fire was more of a \'pre-induction trial\'.<MISC>A senior official</MISC> said the <ORG>Air Force</ORG> has got one version of Akash, but the <ORG>Army</ORG> is yet to follow suit.

The <LOC>Hyderabad</LOC>-based lab of <ORG>DRDO</ORG>, the <ORG>Defence Research</ORG> and <ORG>Development Laboratory (DRDL)</ORG>, is among the major contributors towards development of Akash.<ORG>DRDO</ORG> started developing Akash in the 1980s in collaboration with at least 300 public and private companies, a significant chunk of which were from <STA>Andhra Pradesh</STA>. The missile is often evaluated against the American Patriot SAM but uses an integral ram jet rocket propulsion system in addition to being touted as being more accurate and cheap. Akash aims to replace the Russian 2K12 Kub missiles that are in service presently.Developed indigenously under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme of <MISC>India</MISC>, Akash is an all weather area air defence weapon system for defending vulnerable areas against medium range air targets penetrating from various altitudes.In addition to <ORG>DRDL</ORG>, other major contributors towards development of Akash include <LOC>Chennai</LOC>-based Combat Vehicles Research & Development Establishment (CVRDE), <ORG>High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL)</ORG>, Research & Development Establishment (Engineers) and Armament Research & Development Establishment (ARDE) of Pune.<ORG>Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL)</ORG> at <LOC>Hyderabad</LOC> has reportedly been assigned to produce <MISC>missile systems</MISC>, while <ORG>Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)</ORG>, <LOC>Bangalore</LOC> is the nodal production agency. <ORG>Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL)</ORG>, <LOC>Hyderabad</LOC>, <ORG>Larsen & Toubro</ORG>, <LOC>Mumbai</LOC> and <ORG>Tata Power Company</ORG> <LOC>Mumbai</LOC> are other production partners.Battery Level Radar (BLR) can concurrently track up to 64 targets while simultaneously guiding eight missiles towards four targets at the same time.Immunity to electronic countermeasure environment.Akash can operate in a totally automated hands-free operation mode, from target detection to kill.The supersonic surface-to-air missile has a range of about 25 km and can fly up to a speed of Mach 2.5.With pre-fragmented warhead of 55 kg and safety arming mechanism, Akash boasts of high odds of kills while manoeuvring targets like cruise missiles, fighter aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).Akash can neutralize multiple aerial targets attacking from several directions simultaneously.It has a high flexibility of deployment as it can be launched from mobile as well as static platforms.Akash is equipped with <MISC>advanced battlefield management software</MISC> for performing relative threat computation and pairing of targets and missiles.']"

Bollywood has become an intrinsic part of the Indian social fabric, starting and influencing many fads and trends. <PER>Salman Khan</PER>\'s latest hit Ek Tha Tiger and its massive first day collection brings into focus one of the most popular and celebrated trends followed by movie buffs, watching the first show of a movie on first day of release. To call \'First Day First Show\' a trend would be an understatement. It was a rage, something for which Bollywood fans competed with each other and upped their collars with pride when they could.""The biggest prize of watching the first day first show was the bragging rights. If we saw it, we would rule the conversation and tell others we have already seen this movie. It used to be a great pleasure,"" said <PER>Jyotsna Joshi</PER>, <MISC>president</MISC> of <ORG>Mansi Group</ORG>. For the generation that enjoyed this trend, the procuring of first day first show tickets have now become tales of triumph, laced with bittersweet memories. Cycling many kilometres, standing in long queues under hot sun is not something these film fanatics minded when it came to booking seats.Nothing was too much to get these prize tickets. <PER>Jayshree Panchmatiya</PER>, a housewife, said, ""Bunking college for watching movies was nothing. We saw the first day first show of Sholay in 1975 buying tickets in black. It was totally worth it! With such a big star cast, it was a must watch first day.""But with time, this craze, this madness seems to have watered down. Now the queues in front of booking windows are not that long, and the excitement in today\'s crowd seems to have subdued. According to many the novelty factor is missing from new movie release. ""Due to boom in <MISC><MISC>information tech</MISC>nology</MISC> nothing is secret anymore. The ads and the trailers spill the beans and thus most of the fun is killed,"" said <PER>Saket Agasti</PER>. Earlier, there was no TV or Internet, so the content used to be a surprise.<PER>Sanket Parma</PER>, another fan, said multiple print releases and multiplexes have helped curb the trend. According to <PER>him</PER>, now there were so many seats available. ""With multiplexes, the number of seats and shows have gone up. Anything available in excess is never sought after. Earlier, seats were limited and thus they were in demand, now getting hold of first show tickets is nothing great,"" <PER>he</PER> said.Another reason is movie reviews being out on the day of release itself. ""Also, sometimes people don\'t have time on Fridays and prefer to watch movies over the weekend,"" said <PER>Digvijay Sonak</PER>.There are still some who enjoy the thrill of watching a movie first day first show. They say that the craze for watching this particular show is still there and only the huge availability of seats now hides that fact. ""The trend is still there, no doubt. Just the viewership has been distributed over many theatres that have sprung up all over the city. Big movies and stars still attract a large crowd. <PER>Salman Khan</PER>\'s Eid releases are a great crowdpullers for first day first shows,"" said <PER>Pramod Kumar Munot</PER>, owner of Panchsheel Cinema.In fact, <ORG>PVR Cinemas</ORG> launched in <LOC>Nagpur</LOC> with <PER>Salman</PER>\'s Ek Tha Tiger and ran 15-17 shows on its first day. ""Nearly all the shows, including the first day first ran almost houseful,"" said <PER>Nishant Tandon</PER>, <MISC>junior manager</MISC>, <ORG>PVR</ORG>, <LOC>Nagpur</LOC>.""First day first show craze is still prevalent and especially with multiplex tickets becoming available at comparatively cheap prices, the trend is here to stay. As a matter of fact, on the first day itself, Ek Tha Tiger earned a thumping Rs34,36,200 in <LOC>Nagpur</LOC> itself,"" said <PER>Iqbal Ahmed</PER>, <MISC>local representative</MISC> of the film distributors.""Good movies and fans can never be kept apart,"" says <MISC>city businessman</MISC> <PER>Gaurav Medha</PER>, adding, ""it might be a fact that all the movies don\'t attract many first day first show enthusiasts. That may be because the sheer number of releases now a days. Personally, whenever a movie with good actors and which looks interesting is released I make it a point to watch its first show.""""It\'s basically satisfying your curiosity. The film could be so many things, it\'s finding out what it exactly is and that is the true joy of watching first day first show,"" said <PER>Narayani Ghatwai</PER>, a film fanatic.']"

Power experts said licence suspension can take up to a year.And, in BSES\' case, with the added complication of the <ORG>Appellate Tribunal of Electricity</ORG> barring DERC from taking punitive action against the Reliance discoms without their consent, it could take even longer.

I think if the Koran was not a divine revelation, when it was handed to the book supervisory board, they would say some words did not comply with public chastity and would deny it permission for publication.I would hazard a guess that we wont be seeing The Satanic Verses appear anytime soon in a new Iranian edition, but one hopes that the works of banned Iranian authors such as the great <PER>Sadegh Hedayat</PER>, Shahrnoush Parsipour and the late Houshang Golshiri will be given freer rein now, said <PER>Mitch Albert</PER>, of <ORG>Westbourne Press</ORG>, an independent, <LOC>London</LOC>-based publishing house specialising in books on <MISC><MISC>North </MISC>Africa</MISC> and <MISC><MISC>Wes</MISC>t Asia</MISC>.<PER>He</PER> added: The culture ministers remark that even the Koran would not have passed current censorship laws is certainly a strong one, in the Iranian context. Let us hope it leads to greater freedom of expression. Apart from international imports banned in 2006, such as William Faulkners As I Lay Dying and collections of lyrics by <MISC>the Beatles</MISC> and <MISC>the Rolling Stones</MISC>, the relaxation of censorship could affect scores of works by Iranian authors including <PER>Ebrahim Golestan</PER>, and <PER>Hedayat</PER>, whose novel The Blind Owl was listed as one of <ORG>Irans</ORG> top 10 books by <MISC>journalist</MISC> <PER>Kamin Mohammadi</PER>.   <ORG>Guardian Newspapers Limited</ORG>, 2013']"
