 59293fc77be9e0138af8d8cd A closed liquor outlet in Chandigarh on Saturday. Kamleshwar Singh A closed liquor outlet in Chandigarh on Saturday. Kamleshwar SinghTelangana & Andhra PradeshLiquor shops along the highways in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh functioned normally on Saturday despite of the Supreme Court ban as licences are valid till September 30 and June 30, respectively in both states.As the Supreme Court modified its direction on Friday, stating that the existing licences will be valid till September 30, both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments wont ask liquor shops on highways to close down or shift immediately.We have plenty of time to enforce the Supreme Court guidelines because all liquor shop licences are valid till September 30 in Telangana. When we auction the licences again this September, we will ensure that Supreme Court guidelines are followed and no shop comes up within 220 metres of the highways, Deputy Commissioner of Excise of Telangana S Qureshi said.In Telangana, there are 1,040 liquor shops on highways. About 500 of these shops are on NH-65 and NH-44, and depending on the location, owners paid Rs 30 lakh to Rs 1.10 crore for licences.The liquor shops are often located at places with good accessibility and business advantage. If we suddenly shift to a new location, we may lose all our old customers, said <PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fdd</PER>, owner of Manjunadha Wines on NH-65 where there are at least 300 liquor shops.Excise and police officials are conducting checks at restaurants which have bars attached to discourage them from serving liquor. Action would be taken if they violate the guidelines, Telangana Excise Minister T <PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fda</PER> said.In Andhra Pradesh, there are 1,090 liquor outlets on highways, most of them on the coastal NH-16, and Hyderabad-Vijayawada highway. The liquor licence auction was held in June last year and the licences are valid till June 30 this year.We have closed the bars and pubs located on the highways. Restaurants on highways cannot serve liquor and they have to close their bars. The liquor shops will function till June 30 after which we will conduct auction based on the new guidelines, Andhra Pradesh Excise Minister <PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fd5</PER> said.KarnatakaWith the existing liquor licences being valid till June 30, liquor outlets on the highways in Karnataka have around three months to move to locations outside highway zones to be considered for renewal of their licences.Out of the 10,149 liquor licences issued by the Karnataka Excise Department for liquor stores, bars and hotels, as many as 5,950 licences are with the outlets located within 500 metres of highways  2,510 wine shops, 1,599 bars, 219 star hotels and 173 clubs.The number will be fewer if a distance of 220 metres is taken in areas with a population that is less than 20,000. The Supreme Court had modified its liquor ban order, reducing the distance to 220 metres in areas having a population of up to 20,000.JharkhandOfficials claimed that there were no liquor vends open along the highways beginning Saturday, and a consolidated report would be prepared over the next couple of days.Its a Supreme Court order. We are following it. Various factors arising out of it are being considered and we will prepare a consolidated report, said Excise Secretary <PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fcf</PER>.Of the total 1,432 liquor shops, the state Excise Department has identified at least 670 shops that fall within 500 metres of the highways.As of today all the liquor shops on the highways are closed. Either the operators have closed it on their own or we have sealed them, said another Excise official.With the Jharkhand government planning to enter retail liquor business, over 500 retail liquor vendors have not got their licences extended till August.HaryanaThe Haryana government is likely to lose annual revenue of Rs 100 crore as the state has to close 40 per cent of the total 478 bars located in hotels and restaurants in the state. Most of the bars licensed in Haryana are situated near the highways.On Saturday, Haryana Additional Chief Secretary (Excise and Taxation) <PER>5ce4c39c8c5a90d84965b3c4</PER> confirmed that 194 bars wont be allowed to serve liquor from now on. Its not only the bar licence feebars also attract customers to eat.Those who eat also pay VAT (Value Added Tax) to the state. Loss to the state exchequer would be Rs 100 crore plus because of closure of the barsBars can be relocated but its not easy for the big hotels to move from the current locations, said <PER>5ce4c39c8c5a90d84965b3c4</PER>.But the state government seems relaxed on the issue of liquor vends as it had already made a point in its excise policy that the liquor vends wont be allowed within 500 metres of the highways. We have already auctioned 92 per cent of liquor vends that fall outside the range of 500 m from the highways, said the Additional Chief Secretary.PunjabPunjab Excise department has suspended the licences of about 2500 liquor outlets across the state. Sources said the permits of serving liquor to all such establishments on state and national highways stand cancelled.Not a single outlet served liquor in Punjab on Saturday, said a senior Excise department official. <PER>5ce4c39c8c5a90d84965b3c4</PER> said the department was in the process of compiling the exact number of outlets. We will take a day or two to compile. We have about 1,200 hotels within 500 metres and the rest are other outlets, <PER>5ce4c39c8c5a90d84965b3c4</PER> said.The hotels and marriage venues have, however, contested the number of establishments affected by the order. Over 10,000 outlets, including 3,000 wedding venues, have been affected. Our business has been hit overnight. We are already getting cancellation orders, said <PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fce</PER>, President of Punjab Marriage Palaces-Resorts Owners Association.The <ORG>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fd4</ORG>HOTEL AND RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN INDIA ..</ORG> has planned to file a review petition in the Supreme Court. Confirming the same, <PER>ANAND SINGH RATTANDEEP</PER>, vice-president of North India <ORG>HOTEL AND RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN INDIA ..</ORG>, said,We will be having an all India meeting on April 5 in New Delhi where we will be discussing the review petition.In Ludhiana, 143 vends were located on highways out of which 34 vends will be relocated and licences of rest will not be renewed.Though the SC order was implemented from April 1, all Ludhiana liquor contractors had shut down their vends for about a week. Annual auction of vends was postponed twice on March 29 as well as March 31 and now new dates are yet to be given. Auction has been postponed twice even in Bathinda, Moga, Sangrur districts with contractors boycotting the auction process.West BengalWest Bengal has about 1,800 off-shops within 500 metres of highways, generating a total of over Rs 1,000 crore in revenue for the state, said the state Excise Department. An off shop is essentially a retail outlet that just sells liquor.Last week, the government attempted to preserve its excise revenue by tweaking its liquor licensing policy, by turning off-shops located within 500 metre from the highways into sit-and-drink outlets  a move that the government claimed was within the realm of the SC order. However, the apex courts clarification has now blocked this escape route.An excise department official said, We are following SCs orders and all shops, restaurants and bars that were within the purview of the order have been shut down.The government has targeted excise revenue of Rs 4,778 core in 2016-17. Officials said the state was on course to achieve the target. In 2017-18, the government has budgeted excise collections of Rs 5,781.38 crore.MaharashtraNearly 15,699 liqour outlets shut down in Maharashtra in compliance with the apex courts order. While retail outlets had to shut shop, permit rooms, clubs and hotels had to stop serving liqour.It is a sad day for our industry. It is not only the fear of losing out on business, but hundreds of people working in this industry have lost out on their jobs today, said <PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fdc</PER>, president of the Indian <ORG>HOTEL AND RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN INDIA ..</ORG>.According to some analysts, Maharashtra has a 12-14 per cent share of the total liquor market. The industry contributes nearly Rs 13,000 crore as revenue in the form of excise through the 25,513 liqour vending licencees in the state.Of these, nearly 15,699 licencees lie within the 500 metre distance from highways. We respect the Supreme Court but are angry with the way the state has handled the issue. Last week we were told that we could continue our business as usual and yesterdays decision has come as a shock. We should at least have been allowed to clear out the stocks in our shops, a beer bar owner from Ghatkopar said.Interestingly, the state government, which fears a loss of Rs 7,000 crore in revenue because of the move, has found a novel way to skirt the ban. In Jalgaon, the government on Friday decided to hand over nearly 20 km of highway to the Jalgaon Municipal Corporation.The move meant that these highways were denotified as city roads to be maintianed by the Corporation, which will allow liquor outlets to continue operations on these roads.The Pune Association of Hoteliers and Restaurants, meanwhile, blamed the state and municipal authorities for failing to denotify old highways which are in the heart of the city and have been replaced by new highways bypassing the cities.There are about 1,950 restaurants in Pune municipality that sell liquor. Out of this as many as 1,600 have been affected by the order, said <PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fd8</PER>, president of the association.Hotel owners are now planning to move the Supreme Court with a review petition seeking a remedy of the order.KeralaAround 1,700 liquor vends were forced to shut down in Kerala. Besides, state-run liquor retailers, Bevco and Consumerfed, will now have to relocate 148 outlets from highways out of their 311 shops.Kerala Excise Minister G Sudhakaran said: We are in the process of relocating state-run retail outlets to comply with the SC order. The resistance from locals in places identified for relocation has delayed the process. In case of beer and wine parlours identified for closure, the Excise Department is in the process of sealing the remaining stocks.Of 5,100 toddy shops, 1,080 are located on the highways. Out of 30 five-star category hotels, 11 have had to suspend liquor bar operations. Among the states 34 clubs, 18 cannot operate bars as per the Supreme Court directive.Kerala Finance Minister <PER>5ce4c4b58c5a90d849688c6c</PER> said the decision would impact states revenue. A rough estate showed that the state would lose a revenue of Rs 2,200 crore, <PER>5ce4c4b58c5a90d849688c6c</PER> said.In 2015, when the government banned liquor sale in bars, we had converted them into beer parlours. Without beer business, these hotels would not get any business, said Kerala Beer and Wine Parlours Association president <PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fdb</PER>, adding that the 5000 jobs are likely to be hit in wake of the latest ban.GujaratThe Gujarat home department has instructed the states prohibition department to temporarily shut such wine shops operating on highways in the state.A dry state, there were reported to be 56 licensed liquor shops in Gujarat, of which 12 are on highways. On instruction from the home department, the Director of Prohibition and Excise Department B K <PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fdd</PER> said that officers had been instructed to shut down wine shops operating on highways temporarily.<PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fdd</PER> said, For now, we have asked various Superintendents to temporarily close the wine shops doing retail sale. Based on inputs from the legal department which are awaited by the home department, we may also shut wine shops on highways down permanently In Ahmedabad close to three hotels located on highways including Novotel, TGB and The Ramada have wine shops.<PER>5ce4c9ea8c5a90d849767fd7</PER>, general manager of Novotel Hotel in Ahmedabad, said that while the hotel was awaiting directives on what to do, it was also getting a legal opinion to get more clarity.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

JWALANT SURESHBHAI SHAH 	 ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION 
 59289e887be9e0138af8badc In its seventh year of production,Sakav,the annual magazine by the <ORG>ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION</ORG> (<ORG>ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION</ORG>),continues to highlight the major issues that are faced by people along the Konkan coastlineIt has been named as one of the 34 global biodiversity hotspots and yet when the question of its sustainable development arises,there are few answers forthcoming. The Konkan belt,home to some of the most important forest lands along the North Western Ghats,has problems but few solutions. A primary reason for that is,most people are unaware of the importance of the area. It is one of the few places that has a lot of forest land available to sustain the bio-diversity of the area. Plus,the surrounding the villages totally depend on this kind of forest produce for their daily livelihood, says <PER>JWALANT SURESHBHAI SHAH</PER>,deputy director,<ORG>ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION</ORG> (<ORG>ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION</ORG>).In the year 2004,when the organisation celebrated its 10-year anniversary,they decided to come up with a magazine,Sakav,that would be dedicated to the Konkan belt and the work that is being done there. The word sakav means a bridge that is built during the monsoons over the rivulets that are formed in these regions. As a result,we named the magazine Sakav so that it bridges the gap between the urban world and Konkan so that more and more people would be aware of the issues here, says <PER>JWALANT SURESHBHAI SHAH</PER>.The magazine,an annual affair,deals with the problems that plague the region. <PER>JWALANT SURESHBHAI SHAH</PER> says,When we began in 2004,we touched upon briefly on all the problems in this area. Since then,we have been concentrating on certain issues on an annual basis. Most importantly,we,as city dwellers,do not do all the writing for the magazines,but we ask people from these regions to write about the problems that they experience first hand. Such an important biologically diverse location needs to be given a platform to express itself through the words of the common people who stay there.The area is still underdeveloped,and given its ecological sensitivity,finding a way to develop it is a tough ask. Some of the major issues that have been highlighted over the last seven years include,the industrial sector in Konkan,coastal and maritime development,water management,and in the latest issue,they have touched upon the issue of mining in the Konkan region. <ORG>ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION</ORG> members have been working with locals in these villages to encourage awareness about it.Progress for any people or community is important but it cannot come at the cost of the natural resources that the regions offer. The importance of the Konkan belt can only be understood if one visits the area and sees the huge patches of primary forests, <PER>JWALANT SURESHBHAI SHAH</PER> says.<PER>JWALANT SURESHBHAI SHAH</PER> mentions that even though the magazine doesnt reach out to a lot of people,their efforts are on so that more and more people understand the importance of the work that is being done. The point is,what are the future generations going to have if we do not bother about important places like these? If we do not ensure that development and preservation of the bio-diversity is done seamlessly? These are serious issues that need to be highlighted. And that is what we will continue to do, says <PER>JWALANT SURESHBHAI SHAH</PER>.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

Lochan Singh 	 GLOBAL AUTOTECH LIMITED 
 590343797be9e026559abfd8 New Delhi, July 29: India plans to intensify its campaign against Britains tough post-study work visa norms and the policies of some of its institutions, such as non-recognition of school-leaving certificates, that pose barriers to student movement to that country. HRD minister <PER>5ce4c7a28c5a90d849704b2c</PER>, who took up these issues with high commissioner <PER>5ce4c57e8c5a90d8496aa677</PER> last month, is likely to raise them again when universities and science minister <PER>5ce4c7a28c5a90d849704b29</PER> visits India later this year. <PER>5ce4c7a28c5a90d849704b2c</PER> told <PER>5ce4c57e8c5a90d8496aa677</PER> these barriers were discouraging Indian students from going for higher studies to the UK. Many top institutions, like the London School of Economics, prefer the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Levels or the International Baccalaureate certification. They ask Indian students who have cleared the CBSE exam or the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination to do an add-on course to be eligible for admission to undergraduate courses. The argument given is that school education in India is of 12 years, a year less than the British system. The CBSE has been protesting this practice and had taken up the matter with Universities UK, the organisation that represents British universities. Of late, however, many universities, including Oxford, Warwick and Durham, have been recognising CBSE and CISCE certification as equivalent to UK school board certificates. <PER>5ce4c7a28c5a90d849704b2c</PER> has also claimed that British universities have been treating the IELTS scores, which indicate a students proficiency in English and are asked for by all universities while giving admission, as valid for just one year. Education firms that recruit students for foreign universities say the IELTS score is valid for two years. The third issue <PER>5ce4c7a28c5a90d849704b2c</PER> raised was about the post-study work visa norms  introduced with effect from April 6, 2012  that allow students to work with a minimum salary threshold of 20,000 a year. For foreign students who have just completed their education, its tough landing a job that pays such a package, making it difficult for them to stay back and work. <PER>5ce4c7a28c5a90d849704b2b</PER>, chairman of education overseas consulting firm The Chopras, said the earlier visa policy was misused by foreign students. It prompted the British government to introduce the tough norms, discouraging Indians from choosing Britain as a higher-study destination. If the salary threshold norm is relaxed, many Indian students will prefer to study in the UK, <PER>5ce4c7a28c5a90d849704b2b</PER> said. <PER>Lochan Singh</PER>, <ORG>GLOBAL AUTOTECH LIMITED</ORG>, a Calcutta-based student recruitment firm, said another factor affecting student mobility was that masters degrees given in the UK were not recognised in India. Most UK universities offer one-year masters courses and three-year BTech programmes. Indian institutions offer two-year masters courses and four-year BTech programmes. The University Grants Commission has decided to allow postgraduates from Britain to do a six-month bridge course but no mechanism has been worked out for recognising the three-year BTech degrees UK universities offer.

LAKSHMIKANTHAN KRISHNAN 	 RENAULT NISSAN TECHNOLOGY & BUSINESS CENTRE INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED 
 58fd53ad7be9e06c93719a3e CHENNAI: On a day when the Supreme Court banned firecrackers in Delhi NCR, the Centre indicated that India is close to formulating its own legislation on management and recycling of End-of-life Vehicles (ELVs), whose number is projected to explode to over two crore by 2025.This would be a major step towards cutting down carbon footprint. A recent study by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Indo German Environment Partnership (GIZ-IGEP) in major automobile hubs like Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Indore and Jamshedpur has mapped the key problem areas and the trade chain covering informal sector workers engaged in collection, dismantling, trading and recycling of ELVs.Speaking to Express on the sidelines of a workshop on Status and future of ELV recycling in India, at IIT Madras, <PER>5ce4c4eb8c5a90d849691bc3</PER>, scientist in CPCB, said a cautious approach has been adopted. Sectoral study has been done and Automotive Industry Standard (AIS) for ELV has been published with guidelines being formed. Now, the decision on introducing a regulation should be taken by ministries concerned. But one thing is sure, we are not too far behind, <PER>5ce4c4eb8c5a90d849691bc3</PER> said.As per the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), 20 million vehicles were sold in the year 2015-16. With government contemplating to go for stringent emission norms, the useful age of vehicles will be reduced which calls for advancements in ELV management, which is currently handled by the informal sector unscientifically causing adverse impact on environment and workers health, said <PER>5ce4c4eb8c5a90d849691bc5</PER>, former secretary of Union Environment Ministry and currently member of the Scientific Advisory Council of the Cabinet.<PER>5ce4c4eb8c5a90d849691bc3</PER> said Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) was one of the possibilities under consideration at the ministerial level to deal with ELVs. Under EPR, the manufacturer or importer of the product is responsible for the entire life cycle of the product i.e. ELV. This responsibility starts at the design stage of the vehicle. The producers responsibility for a product is hence extended beyond manufacturing to post-consumer stage. This is the norm in several countries like Japan, Korea etc.Government of India has proposed to set-up modern recycling centres like National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRIP) in Chennai. It also proposes an incentive plan for customers to return old vehicles and build eight car scrap centres near ports around the country, <PER>5ce4c4eb8c5a90d849691bc3</PER> said.<PER>LAKSHMIKANTHAN KRISHNAN</PER>, Vice President, Product Engineering, <ORG>RENAULT NISSAN TECHNOLOGY & BUSINESS CENTRE INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> and Business Centre India Pvt Ltd, told Express that the company would have no problem with extended producers responsibility, if the government provides fair incentives to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer). If we get good incentives, we can pump that money into the product towards design etc, <PER>LAKSHMIKANTHAN KRISHNAN</PER> said.What is ELV as per AIS-129? End-of-Life Vehicle is a vehicle readdy to be scrapped by its last owner Why recycle? It is estimated that passenger cars contain about 70% steel and 7-8% aluminum Recycling 1 ton of steel conserves 1,134 kg of iron ore, 635 kg of coal and 54,4 kg of limestone, thereby conserving energy besides reducing environmental impact It will generate seconday material sink reducing use of virgin materials Secondary metals are processed using technologies requiring less energyGlobal practices India: There is no ELVs law or recycling policy. There is no concept of de-registration. Currently, inter-ministerial group has been formed to brainstorm the issue and formulate regulations, which are at draft stage European Union: Has ELV law. Vehicle manufacturer is responsible for free take back and recycling cost Japan: Has ELV law. Shared responsibility of owner, manufacturer & recycler China: Has ELV law and traded as valuable secondary resource US: No regulation, but traded as valuable secondary resource

NILADRI SEKHAR ROY 	 MAHANADI COALFIELDS LIMITED 
 58ff6ccc7be9e0420db30e93 Durgapur, July 31: Around 200 workers were stranded in seven coal mines of Asansol for around four hours when a blackout affecting half the country cut off electricity to lifts in their underground pits, an Eastern <ORG>MAHANADI COALFIELDS LIMITED</ORG> offcial said. <ORG>MAHANADI COALFIELDS LIMITED</ORG> authorities used power from the Dishergarh Power Supply Corporation to operate emergency lifts to bring out the workers, who were working in the first shift from 8am. There was no threat to their lives or any reason to panic. We managed to lift all the 200 miners safe by 5.30pm with the help of power from the DPSC. said <PER>NILADRI SEKHAR ROY</PER>, a senior <ORG>MAHANADI COALFIELDS LIMITED</ORG> official. After grids collapsed around 1pm, the workers had got trapped in the mines in Sodepur and Satgram. The exhaust fans and lights at the 400 feet deep tunnels also stopped working, sending the miners into a panic. We were trying to see with the help of battery-operated torches fitted on our safety helmets. But we felt suffocated as the exhaust fans stopped working. We also feared a crack in the walls which can cause a flood in the mine, said a miner at Chinakuri near Asansol. Most lifts in the underground mines of <ORG>MAHANADI COALFIELDS LIMITED</ORG> are operated through electricity though some of them also function with the help of steam. According to the authorities, production at all the 84 underground mines of <ORG>MAHANADI COALFIELDS LIMITED</ORG> had to be stopped in the first shift, leading to a loss of Rs 5 crore. The mines produce around 6,000 to 7,000 tones of coals each in three shifts of eight hours. We have already lost one shift and if power cannot be resumed by tonight, work in the other two shifts will also be hampered, <PER>NILADRI SEKHAR ROY</PER> said. Production was partially possible through diesel-operated machines at some of the open-cast mines. Officials also feared the loss in production would prevent them from supplying coal to the thermal power plants in the state tomorrow. If production is not resumed soon, we will fail to supply coal to the power plants tomorrow, a senior <ORG>MAHANADI COALFIELDS LIMITED</ORG> official said in the evening.

 592861a57be9e0138af8ae06 Poor buying sentiments in the housing market of Ahmedabad seems to be pushing several large real-estate companies to explore business opportunities and diversify their risks in the tried and tested,affordable, format of one-bedroom-hall-kitchen or 1 BHK.<ORG>5ce4c39c8c5a90d84965b4e0</ORG> on Thursday announced their decision to build about 500 housing units in this format at the <ORG>5ce4c39c8c5a90d84965b4e0</ORG> Garden City project,where the firm has been developing two- and three BHK apartments that are currently priced over Rs 35 lakh and Rs 80 lakh respectively. <ORG>5ce4c39c8c5a90d84965b4e0</ORG> will be offering a 600 square feet apartment at prices starting from Rs 16.5 lakh,a company official said.One the top revenue earners for <ORG>5ce4c39c8c5a90d84965b4e0</ORG>,the <ORG>5ce4c39c8c5a90d84965b4e0</ORG> Garden City project contributed revenues to the tune of Rs 49.1 crore in the third quarter of the current financial year. This is a substantial 40 per cent drop in revenues when compared to Rs 82.3 crore it earned from the project during the same period last year.The decision to come up with 1 BHK housing units is seen as a move to bolster revenues in a market that has been stagnating since the last one year or so,say real estate experts.Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL),a global property consultant observes in its report on Affordable Housing,During the demand slowdown in 20082009,residential developers realised that they had concentrated development portfolios in upper-mid- and luxury segments,where the market has become very competitive in the last decade due to the entry of new players. Affordable housing segment provides an appropriate option to diversify their risks.However,we are yet to see a phase seen around 2008-09 when a large number of developers had suddenly taken up affordable housing, says <PER>5ce4c8e38c5a90d84973a265</PER>,head of Ahmedabad operations of JLL.Now that the supply in two and three BHK segments is more than the demand,we see developers moving on to the 1 BHK segment where the demand is high.Similar has been the case with Adani Township & Real Estate which is building a premium development in the city. The firm recently floated a new affordable housing project to tap the demand in this segment,that would release about 800 units of 1BHK and 2BHK houses that are priced between Rs 16-22 lakh.As per Central government figures,the urban housing shortage is estimated to be over 18 million for the next five year plan from 2012-17,of which 96 per cent are in economically weaker section (EWS) and low income group (LIG) categories.Experts also feel that the recent move of the Reserve Bank of India to allow external commercial borrowings up to $1 billion for low-cost affordable housing projects and the plan to allow more FDI in this segment would give a further boost.Another player in the segment,Tata Housing is already in the process of developing 1,800 units in Ahmedabad,jointly with <ORG>ARVIND LIMITED</ORG> Real Estate,is seeing decent demand. We have been able to sell houses in the second phase at a decent pace. We are now planning a third phase as well, said <PER>KAMAL SINGAL</PER>,CEO,<ORG>ARVIND LIMITED</ORG> Real Estate,the realty arm of textile major <ORG>ARVIND LIMITED</ORG>.Tata Housing signed a memorandum of understanding with the Gujarat government worth Rs 3,500 crore to develop affordable homes in Ahmedabad at the recently held Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors Summit 2013 held in January .This edition of the summit attracted about Rs 1.34 lakh crore investments to the sector where firms from United States,Finland,United Kingdom and others had promised investments to bring in technology and provide technical support to build affordable houses in Gujarat.These initiatives by private developers comes at a time when the state government has promised to build 50 lakh affordable homes across the state within five years.To provide the necessary impetus,the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority in its recent city development plan has earmarked a 76 square kilometre area as a special affordable housing zone.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

 593fe17e7be9e024e45972ee Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar corridor,Construction of 175-m-long cable-stayed bridge will kick off in a weekThe construction of the citys second cable-stayed bridge,a section of the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro Rail corridor,is all set to commence. With work on the pylons now nearing completion on either side of the Western Express Highway at Andheri,work will begin within a week on constructing a 175-metre-long complex structure that will zoom across the 13-metre-tall Jog flyover 22 metres above ground,approximately the height of a 10-storey building.This cable-stayed portion is one of the most crucial parts of the 11.4-km route of the citys first Metro rail corridor and will run perpendicular to the highway and the flyover.Officials of <ORG>MUMBAI METRO TRANSPORT PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> have promised there will be no traffic diversions on the road even while work continues 247. We are using a very advanced technology to build this bridge. The entire structure would be constructed segment-wise on site and there would be no need for closure of any road during the construction. The first segment of the bridge would be cast within a week on the Ghatkopar-end of the bridge, said K P <PER>UMADEVI MAHESHWARI</PER>,Director of <ORG>MUMBAI METRO TRANSPORT PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>.While the deck of the cable-stayed bridge will be 22 metres high,the two pylons on either side stand 41 metres tall. Cable-stayed bridges are built with one or more columns,called pylons,with cables supporting the bridges deck. Such bridges dont require construction of piers on the ground where there are obstacles or lack of space,in this case the very busy Jog flyover.According to <ORG>UMADEVI MAHESHWARI</ORG>49c8c5a90d849684caf</PER>,a form-traveller,a 48-tonne mould of the segment would be used to cast the 3-metre-long segment,which will be later stressed with cables for strength. While a section of Bandra-Worli Sea Link is the citys first cable-stayed bridge,that was constructed with pre-cast segments that were then lifted from barges by cranes and later stressed together.Four such form-travellers would be used to expedite the work. After the segments concrete gains required strength,longitudinal prestressing and stay cables will be installed and stressed as per approved specifications and drawings. We expect the work on the portion to be complete by September, <ORG>UMADEVI MAHESHWARI</ORG>49c8c5a90d849684caf</PER> added.There would be 20 cables to make the bridge look aesthetically beautiful. The sheer complexity of the cable-stayed bridge,that is expected to cost around Rs 16 crore,would force the concessionaire to deploy close to 400 labourers and engineers day and night. Except concreting,for which we require concrete mixers and huge concrete pouring booms,all other work would be done during the day, <ORG>UMADEVI MAHESHWARI</ORG>49c8c5a90d849684caf</PER> added.The <ORG>MUMBAI METRO TRANSPORT PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> engineers will be aided by Swiss firm VSL International Ltd,experienced in building such bridges.<ORG>MUMBAI METRO TRANSPORT PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> officials said there will be three spans. The main span over the flyover will be 83 metres long,the other two on either side of the flyover will stretch 46 metres. The four form-travellersworking from the two ends will cast segments and come towards the centre of the flyover to complete the bridge. At that point,we may have to stop use of the flyover. We would do this during the night when there is not much traffic. Motorists can use the road below for a few hours at night, <ORG>UMADEVI MAHESHWARI</ORG>49c8c5a90d849684caf</PER> added.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App

JAYKUMAR KHANDERAO PATHARE 	 DHANLAXMI BANK LIMITED 
 58fd9efa7be9e012bf28478c KOCHI: The call came from Madhya Pradesh a few weeks ago, recalls Rajiv, a native of Kochi and a victim of an attempted phishing call.The caller said that she was calling on behalf of State Bank of India and wanted to confirm my address to issue a new debit card, which was supposed to be safer. Even though the expiry period of my existing card was August 2018, I was glad that the bank is concerned about the safety of my account, he added.But the call quickly took a turn toward the suspicious. After confirming his address, the caller asked for the card number. She even told me the last eight numbers, recalls Rajiv. Then, he was asked for the Card Verification Value (CVV). But Rajiv received an from his bank to confirm a payment of `10,000 providing the CVV. Rajiv spooked and cut the call. She even dared to tell me that I should not disclose CVV to anyone other than her. I smelled a rat , he admitted.Rajiv is not alone. Had he disclosed the number, he might have ended up among the innocent duped that fall for phishing attempts like these every day. Rajiv contacted the bank and they confirmed that it was a fraud and, upon their advice, has applied for a new debit card.The recent data breach brings into stark focus the danger to our hard earned money in a world of electronic, impresonal transactions. Despite the size of the breach, many have been lucky to have not lost any money. But our cards are still vulnerable to financial fraud at all times. According to the <ORG>5ce4c3088c5a90d8496443b2</ORG>, illegal withdrawals linked to the data breach were limited to 641 customers of 19 banks and the total amount was a mere `1.3 crore.But the next such lapse might be more severe and the incident is already raising concerns on the robustness of <ORG>5ce4c3088c5a90d8496443b2</ORG> ATM banking systems. Experts suggest that spread of biometric ATMs and extending the One Time Password (OTP) feature to ATM transactions as safety measures.Banks in India have introduced biometric automatic teller machines (ATMs) as it seems to be an effective way of preventing PIN theft and is also a channel to expand a banks reach to the rural and illiterate masses. Globally, biometric as a method of authentication gains traction, said P G <PER>JAYKUMAR KHANDERAO PATHARE</PER>, Former Managing Director and CEO, <ORG>DHANLAXMI BANK LIMITED</ORG>.The biometric ATMs replace personal identity numbers (PIN) with thumb impressions. The fingerprint scanner fitted in the machine only recognizes thecustomers thumb impression, <PER>JAYKUMAR KHANDERAO PATHARE</PER> suggests.Biometric ATMs might be safer, but the drawback is that If the account holder is bedridden and in need of money from <PER>JAYKUMAR KHANDERAO PATHARE</PER> account <PER>JAYKUMAR KHANDERAO PATHARE</PER> will not be able to get it as <PER>JAYKUMAR KHANDERAO PATHARE</PER> has to present in person at the ATM. The other option is the extension of OTP precautions to ATM withdrawals.The negative side of this extra safety is that it is time consuming and inconvenient.Abraham Tharian, Former Executive Director, South Indian Bank added that in order to avoid skimming the customer must ensure that the card does not go beyond his eyesight.The Reserve Bank is now closely monitoring the situation and in the future it will come forward with safety features in order to safer guard the interest of banking customer, he added.According to <PER>JAYKUMAR KHANDERAO PATHARE</PER>, the massive distribution of cards in the recent years has led to such fraudulent activities. <PER>JAYKUMAR KHANDERAO PATHARE</PER> has a point as there are 69.7 crore debit cards and 2.6 crore credit cards in the country at the end of the month of July, 2016.Safety Tips Always pay close attention to the ATM and your surroundings. Dont select an ATM at the corner of a building. Use an ATM located near the center of a building. It is always safe to use ATMs of your own bank. It also makes it easy to complain if you encounter any problems. Chip cards are safer. So if your card is electromagnetic replace it with a chip card Change PIN number every three months. Do not ever disclose numbers on the card to anyone. Do your automated banking in a public, well-lighted location that is free of shrubbery and decorative partitions or dividers. If you have started a transaction and notice something suspicious, cancel the transaction and take your card. Be wary of people trying to help you with ATM transactions. Be aware of anyone sitting in a parked car nearby. Do not allow people to look over your shoulder as you enteryour PIN. Closely monitor your bank statements and balances, and immediately report any problems to your bank.

 58fd3ac27be9e06c937178c5 Some of the biggest and most lucrative sectors have taken a beating post-demonetisation of high denomination notes; and while many are optimistic about long term benefits, it is likely to take monthsNBFC AND MFIThe demonetisation drive was a jackpot for banks, with their deposit base swelling but the Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFC) and Micro Finance Institutions have a very different story to tell. Not only have they felt the pressure during the first few days, they also expect impact lasting for several months. The sheer shock that the sector has taken was evident from the 16-20 per cent slump in stock prices of listed NBFCs.The reason is simple. These companies transact mostly in cash and the sudden ban on large denomination notes has put a full stop to their business. A large majority of NBFCs are also in the gold loan space and they pulled down shutters in just days after the announcement, when the weekly disbursal amount was restricted to only `20,000.Business has become unbelievably dull and I dont know whether these are short term ramifications or are here to stay, said Divya S, who works for Muthoot Financial Corporation Ltd. Neither are we able to lend to our clients, nor are they being able to pay the debts on their loans.While medium to short term impact is bad, most seem pretty optimistic about the long term benefits. Demonetisation will impact non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in the next 3-4 months and not in the long run, said <PER>5ce4c3108c5a90d8496457ff</PER> of Macquarie Capital Securities. Due to monetisation there will be some disruptions in collection and loan disbursement as most of our customers are from the bottom of the pyramid. This will be for a couple of weeks and will come back to normalcy, said V P <PER>NANDAKUMAR KALATH</PER>, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, <ORG>MANAPPURAM FINANCE LIMITED</ORG>.According to <PER>5ce4c4c78c5a90d84968ba1d</PER>, CEO & MD of FINO PayTech, MFIs and their customers will face some inconvenience, but with a rural economy driven by cash, there is no question of people losing faith in it. In the long run, digital money and cash will co-exist. We need to understand that the rural economy is cash driven  wages, savings, transactions, even businesses. With restrictions on cash there has been an impact on new loan disbursals, <PER>5ce4c4c78c5a90d84968ba1d</PER> said. However, the question of how to survive the short and medium term impact is vexing. There has been a scramble to digitise. Henceforth, MFIs will employ innovative digital solutions to engage with customers in rural areas, <PER>5ce4c4c78c5a90d84968ba1d</PER> added.The problem is that the bottom-lines of these companies, with nearly zero business, are likely to take big hits in the next quarters.REAL ESTATEOne of the largest sectors staring at an abyss it has to leap over is the unwieldy, highly unorganised real estate sector. Long suspected as one of the largest breeding grounds of black money, the sector, already flagging for the last two years, has taken a body blow. Players and experts both state that a shrinking cash economy will see already poor demand fall even further.But the abyss is not endless and can be leaped over, says the industry. And the benefits on the other side might well justify the pain. If black money was one of the reasons real estate prices have remained inflated despite low demand, prices should come down to realistic levels.The end-users will be able to buy properties of their choice at affordable prices, says <PER>5ce4c4c78c5a90d84968ba1c</PER>, CEO - Residential Services, JLL India. The legal banking/financing channels have so far accounted for only a small part of all transactions in the premium/luxury real estate space. Demonetisation is likely to result in luxury property prices dipping by as much as 25-30 per cent, as sellers struggle to offload properties, point out experts.The real estate sector will definitely be affected by the demonetisation exercise, as it has traditionally seen a very high involvement of black money and cash transactions. However, almost all such incidences have been in the secondary sales market, where cash components have traditionally been a veritable must. In other words, the resale properties segment will take a big hit. The luxury and high-end segments of residential real estate will also see a major impact from this exercise, since it is another area which has seen a lot of payments done in cash, added <PER>5ce4c4c78c5a90d84968ba19</PER>.The move will lead to a sharp fall in land prices. The hike in land value in recent times was mainly triggered by black money accumulated in the system. It is estimated that 40 per cent of the economy is black money driven. About 10 per cent of the real estate market is driven by this unaccounted money. Immediately the inflated prices will come down to realistic levels, said S N <PER>5ce4c46c8c5a90d84967ce37</PER>, national vice-president, CREDAIThere has been stagnation in sales in the real estate sales for some time mainly because of unrealistic prices.Owing to demonetisation, land prices will come down. As of now it is difficult to predict whether flat/apartment prices will be reduced, added <PER>5ce4c3018c5a90d84964353f</PER> G, founder prognoadvisor.com, a Financial planning firm.LUXURYBusinesses in the luxury products segment have suffered a huge blow following the demonetisation move. Albeit temporary, those in the field believe it will still be months before businesses stabilise again.As of now, the priority is basic necessities, they say. People are just looking at buying what is necessary to survive, pointed out <PER>5ce4c4c78c5a90d84968ba1b</PER>, National Sales Manager, Pioneer India Electronics Pvt Ltd. This could be a temporary phenomenon. But as of now, what we see is that the customer is missing. It is not just ours, it has had an impact on all businesses. The sales of luxury products across segments have been affected by at least 50 percent and it will take at least another three to four months for normalcy to return, <PER>5ce4c4c78c5a90d84968ba1b</PER> added.Another sector catering to luxury products which has taken a significant hit is the jewellery business. Sales have dropped drastically in the last few days by at least 70 percent, according to Y S <PER>5ce4c30c8c5a90d849644e8d</PER>, President, Jewellers Association Bangalore. Jewelers have stopped taking new orders because they are unable to pay wages of workers. Even with pending orders, several customers have been unable to pick up the orders they had placed as stores are accepting only cards. The worst hit have been the middle and the lower middle class who had planned family events and were looking for gold purchases.The upper middle class customers who would anyway swipe their cards, are not affected. Even here, we find that people rarely use credit cards and mostly stick to debit cards, <PER>5ce4c3018c5a90d84964353f</PER> said, adding that it would take at least a year before sales picked up again.Automobile dealers have seen marked sales drops in all segments, but the impact is likely to be long term in the luxury automobiles segment.Other segments that have seen sales come to a screeching halt are high definition Television sets, costly furniture and home decor. These segments have usually gotten by on significant cash transactions, even high ticket ones. The move has pulled the rug from under us. I do not see any luxury product segment growing for the next year, said a manager of a multi-brand retail store.

 5928f3837be9e0137c781d69 Stock markets may remain volatileNew Delhi, Sep 22, 2013, PTI: 14:51 ISTStock markets are likely to remain volatile this week as investors come to terms with an unexpected hike in interest rate by the RBI and portfolio churning ahead of the September derivatives contract expiry, according to experts.The surprise move from the RBI has reversed the bullish tone of the markets as the 25 basis point rise in repo rate caught market participants completely off-guard, brokers said. The RBI raised the short-term policy repo rate to 7.5 per cent from 7.25 per cent, saying inflation had to be lowered to more tolerable levels. The RBI also partially eased its liquidity-tightening steps that were unveiled to defend a weakening rupee.This week will see expiry of September months F&O contracts (on Thursday) so volatility will tend to remain high. Meanwhile, the markets are likely to consolidate in the broad range of 5,800-6,150 and form a base for next directional move, said <PER>5ce4c4f78c5a90d849693de5</PER>, President (Retail Distribution), <ORG>5ce4c3278c5a90d849648f0d</ORG>.Stock markets would also monitor trend in foreign fund investment and global cues for further direction. Overseas investors have pumped in over $1.7 billion in the Indian stock market so far this month.The BSE benchmark had lost 383 points on Friday, the most in three weeks, after RBI monetary policy review. The Sensex had surged 684.48 points to an almost 3-year high on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve refrained from easing its stimulus programme. For the entire week, the index gained 2.69 per cent to close at 20,263.71.The deferment in withdrawal of quantitative easing by the US has given Indian policy makers a breathing space of three months at the least and six months at the best, said P H <PER>ravikumar.d</PER>, Managing Director, <ORG>CAPRI GLOBAL CAPITAL LIMITED</ORG>.

 58ff3c5d7be9e0429666ef4d If the information and broadcasting ministry agrees to a proposal by Prasar <ORG>BHARTI AIRTEL LIMITED</ORG>  its broadcast arm  India will have a digital channel to tell the India story to challenge the anti-India narrative in foreign media.In a report submitted to the ministry on Wednesday, a Prasar Bharati Committee on establishing a Digital Platform for India has suggested a platform that will report on international news to a global digital audience with an India perspective.Targeted at English speaking audiences, global opinion makers and influences and the Indian diaspora, the digital channel will change the narrative that presents India as a constant point of conflict between Hindu nationalists and so-called secularism, said A Surya <PER>PRAKASH SUBRAMANIAM</PER>, Prasar <ORG>BHARTI AIRTEL LIMITED</ORG> chairman who also headed the committee.Pegged to cost over Rs 75 crore, the digital platform will have correspondents across the globe to bring news to Indian audiences as well as present new of the new India that is emerging. It will be a 24x7 operation on internet platforms.The big story is that India is the most diverse and vibrant democracy; lot of things are happening, we have a government that would get a better rating than many others (governments). Yet, the whole discourse seems to be the constant conflict between Hindus and Muslims, which is totally bogus, <PER>PRAKASH SUBRAMANIAM</PER> told HT on Thursday.New Delhi is peeved at international media reports that they claim to portray India negatively.

It found 11.5 per cent cases negligent towards mosquito-breeding sites.Of 1,370 buildings of the <ORG>Public Works Department</ORG>, including staff quarters, offices and other buildings, 599 water tanks were found non-mosquito-proof.The Central Railways (CR) ranked next with 418 non-mosquito-proof tanks found in 544 buildings of the railways staff quarters, offices, stations and other buildings. The Central <ORG>Public Works Department</ORG> buildings were found to have 368 such possible breeding sites.The survey took place after a notice to prevent mosquito breeding to avoid dengue infection was sent by BMCs additional municipal commissioner to 10 government agencies in March. This was a measure for monsoon preparedness. With rains, empty tanks provide favourable climate for Aedes Aegypti mosquito to breed, said insecticide officer <PER>5ce4c6ef8c5a90d8496e66df</PER>.Since January, 87 dengue cases were reported by civic health department. Aedes Aegypti mosquito is the only agent that transfers the virus and breeds mostly in fresh water.No one, not even government bodies can escape the responsibility. We have conveyed to all government bodies, including Army, Navy, Port Trust, that they need to ensure about dengue prevention. We will issue a notice if necessary and prosecution will be done, said Municipal Commissioner <PER>AJOY MEHTA</PER>.Responding to The Indian Express, <ORG>Public Works Department</ORG> Principal Secretary <PER>5ce4ca808c5a90d84977feae</PER> said <PER>5ce4ca808c5a90d84977feae</PER> was not aware of the BMC notice.

 58fc6ad6a3d24b44f3220712 High demand:The SME segment, unveiled in 2012, has seen more than 200 firms list on the platform in NSE and BSE.Investment bankers want the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to allow anchor investors in public issues of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) while also enhancing the upper limit for paid-up capital of such companies to allow relatively larger firms to enter the capital market while ensuring institutional investor participation in the dedicated segment.The segment for SMEs, unveiled separately by BSE and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 2012, has seen a lot of action with a more than 200 companies currently listed on the platform. While BSE has more than 170 companies listed on its SME segment, NSE has close to 50 entities on board.Incidentally, the recent past also saw a few institutional investors participate in the segment but that has been far and few. Fund houses like Reliance Mutual Fund and DSP BlackRock Mutual Fund have invested in a few SME IPOs. Union Bank of India and SIDBI also invested in this segment, which saw a foreign investor participate once.Regulatory pushMerchant bankers said that if the segment receives a regulatory push then entities like banks, mutual funds, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and financial institutions would subscribe to SME IPOs quite frequently.Merchant bankers want the regulator to evaluate the option of allowing anchor investors in SME IPOs  as is the case with public issues on the main board. Anchor investors are institutional investors that can bid for shares ahead of the IPO and have a lock-in of 30 days.With SME segment growing leaps and bounds, we are being approached by many institutions who are keen to participate as anchors in SME IPOs, said <PER>MADHU LUNAWAT</PER>, Managing Director, <ORG>PANTOMATH CAPITAL ADVISORS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, an investment banking entity that has handled the maximum number of SME IPOs. However, the existing regulatory framework does not permit it, <PER>MADHU LUNAWAT</PER> saidMarket participants also want the regulator to enhance the paid-up capital cap from the current Rs. 25 crore so that slightly larger companies can tap the segment to get acclimatised with the compliance requirements before moving to the main board.Recently, Euro India Fresh Foods came out with an IPO to raise Rs. 51 crore  the largest till date. Data from Prime Database showed that the 2016-17 saw a total of 78 SME IPOs raising a cumulative amount of over Rs. 800 crore  a close to a threefold jump from the previous fiscal that saw Rs. 311 crore being raised from 50 issues.A group of investment bankers are to meet the new SEBI chairman <PER>5ce4c3828c5a90d849656e5e</PER> next week and these proposals are expected to be part of the larger suggestions that the banking community presents to the regulator.

VINOD KUMAR DUGAR 	 HAILEYBURIA TEA ESTATES LTD 
 58fd36727be9e06c937172dd KOCHI: Tea is one of the most consumed beverages in India, maybe second only to water. With the government all set to fix minimum wages for plantation workers in tea-growing states, it is safe to assume that tea prices are only set to go up.Even though the price of tea is also connected with the price of milk and sugar, the crisis in tea plantations are likely to push up the price of a cup of tea. According to experts, the price will go up from Rs 8-15 per cup now to at least Rs 18-20 not too far in the future.The reason is simple - when production cost increases, with the increase in wages, companies will pass it on to customers. The current wage in Assam is Rs 126 per day. But rumours of a minimum wage of Rs 250 is doing the rounds. If this happens, the production cost will double in an instant, making tea dearer for consumers.In South India, which produces 20 per cent of tea in the country, a similar issue is brewing. The basic wage in Tamil Nadu is Rs 223 and is all set for revision by January 2017.Tea is a common mans drink and remains so. There is still resistance at the retail level to pay higher prices. The primary price of Indian tea has increased in absolute terms but not in real terms, while costs have increased manifold. The wages account for the largest share in the cost of production. The labour costs account for 60 per cent of the total cost of the plantation sector, pointed out N <PER>5ce4c32e8c5a90d849649b34</PER>, former President, United Planters Association of South India (UPSAI), adding, By agreeing to a reasonable increase in basic wages and raising the productivity over kilo rate will help reduce the cost of production without compromising on the wages of workers.Per kg prices of tea were Rs 110-148 (Assam), Rs 62-71 (South India) and Rs 65-81 (West Bengal) in September 2015. The average price of tea during September this year was Rs 117-136 (Assam), Rs 84-97 (South India) and Rs 99-106 (West Bengal).The tea plantation industry in the country is going through various issues. The minimum wages in the tea plantations in the country ranges between Rs 82 (Tripura) to Rs 235 (Kerala). The wages in Tamil Nadu are all set for revision by January 2017. If the wage increases there it will cause a chain reaction in the country and price may go up, said <PER>VINOD KUMAR DUGAR</PER>, Managing Director, <ORG>HAILEYBURIA TEA ESTATES LTD</ORG>68a706</PER> Estates, a veteran in the sector.South Indias plantation industry pays one of the highest basic wages and it is as high as Rs 232 for the tea plantation workers in Kerala, the highest in the country. But according to C <PER>5ce4c32c8c5a90d849649a22</PER>, former Chairman, Association of Planters of Kerala this proportion is not sustainable.Introduction of a productivity linked wages will increase the earning potential of the workforce, without detrimentally affecting the plantations. It is the responsibility of the Local self-Governments to look after the Social amenities like drinking water, medical, sanitation, roads. But LSGs exclude plantation workers while providing such benefits, <PER>5ce4c32c8c5a90d849649a22</PER> added.In <PER>5ce4c32c8c5a90d849649a22</PER> opinion, it is high time for state governments to intervene and take the burden off from plantation companies and provide basic facilities in plantation areas.V Unnikrishnan, Sr Vice President-Plantations, A V Thomas Group Companies seconds the opinion saying that If the wages go up companies will be in a fix and they would pass on the burden to consumers.With inflated wages, plantations will not be able to fulfil their commitment of providing social amenities. Hence the strain will be reflected on tea prices, <PER>5ce4c32c8c5a90d849649a22</PER> added.

 593d6c987be9e00e964d5d97 Though advance monsoon is likely to cast its impact on the heavy tourists inflow,the state government has finally woken up to the call to save Rohtang Pass by banning movement of all such vehicles having registration numbers of other states.Only vehicles which are registered in <ORG>HIMACHAL PRADESH POWER CORPORATION LIMITED</ORG> will get an unrestricted access to move up to Rohtang,or even across 13,051 feet Rohtang Pass. The tourists traveling to Lahual Valley or Leh will need special permits from Sub-Divisional Magistrate,Manali.This category also include tourists vehicles from outside the state,who are taking Rohtang Pass as route to Keylong and Leh-Ladakh.This is the first major decision which the <ORG>5ce4c35b8c5a90d849650589</ORG> took last week after realising threat of serious environmental degradations and prolonged traffic jams of nearly 20,000 to 21,000 tourists travelling to Rohtang Pass everyday.The scientists at G B Pant Institutute of Environment and Development have also warned about serious problems at Rohtang,which the vehicular movement is not regulated.State Chief secretary <PER>5ce4ccec8c5a90d8497e98ab</PER>,who also heads a high courts high power committee on regulating traffic on Manali-Rohtang Pass and keeping the road free from traffic jams,said: No vehicle bearing the registration number else than <ORG>HIMACHAL PRADESH POWER CORPORATION LIMITED</ORG> will allowed beyond Kothi. The tourists reaching Manali are advised not to drive uphill as it involves risks to their lives,and also poses threat to the environment. They are welcome to hire local taxis.The decision to close Rohtang drive for outside vehicles is understood to have approval of Chief Minister <PER>5ce4c31f8c5a90d8496479e6</PER>,who himself had shared the concern over 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles moving up to to Rohtang daily,resulting in day-long traffic jams,parking problem and also environment degradations.Reports say after the restrictions came into force,the number of vehicles reaching Rohtang has come down to 2,000 to 3,000.<ORG>HIMACHAL PRADESH POWER CORPORATION LIMITED</ORG>st week introduced three luxury basis for the tourists for Rohtang,today added another bus to meet the tourists demand. Two more buses will be added in next few days as decided at the meeting,which was convened by the chief secretary some days back, said <PER>VINOD KUMAR TIWARI</PER>,<ORG>HIMACHAL PRADESH POWER CORPORATION LIMITED</ORG>.Before the tourists season,the government had taken a decision to ply shuttle buses. But non-availability of the 24-seat buses left the official agencies,including Himachal Roadways Transport Corporation (HRTC),with no option but to wait for the next season.Says <PER>5ce4ccec8c5a90d8497e98ab</PER>,We have thought of another option to explore possibilities of buying own buses out of the Green Tax fund,which has been collected from the tourist vehicles entering Manali town.The government is quite serious on this issue and will find some way out to launch shuttle buses.About resistance of outside tourists and even hoteliers,Deputy Commissioner <PER>5ce4ccec8c5a90d8497e98ac</PER> said,The local administration is trying to tackle it by educating the tourists. Its in their interests as lesser the number of vehicles moving up,better it would be for all of us. We have not banned tourists going to Rohtang,only vehicles are prohibited, <PER>5ce4ccec8c5a90d8497e98ac</PER> said.There are also other places in Kullu-Manali,where the tourists can go and enjoy.Its strange. Those who are driving all the way from Delhi,Haryana and Punjab with three or four-day package feel cheated. The <ORG>5ce4c35b8c5a90d849650589</ORG> should have announced it in advance, says <PER>5ce4c4728c5a90d84967de92</PER>,a tourist from Delhi.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App

The airport handles over one lakh passengers every day and aircraft movements have also increased. Almost 1,185 arrivals/departures took place from here every day.The addition of new routes in domestic and international sectors by major airlines has helped Delhi airport emerge as a leading hub airport. Airlines are attracted to Delhi airport as we have a large catchment area and unlike other Indian airports, we have virtually no constraints as far as accommodating future growth is concerned. Execution of the expansion works as per the proposed Master Plan will further enhance the facilities enabling air traffic to grow at a faster pace, said I <PER>SNEHA PRABHAKAR PATIL</PER>, CEO-<ORG>DELHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>.As domestic airlines, especially budget carriers, are growing at a faster rate, <ORG>DELHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> has decided to double the capacity of Terminal 1, which now caters to only low-cost carriers.

 58fd130a7be9e06c93714548 KOCHI: Kochi Metro is all set to start operations from next month. But <ORG>APOLLO TYRES LIMITED.</ORG>, one of the largest industrial firms in Kerala, is not so happy about it. Though the company had happily handed over 60 cents of land to construct Metro station at Kalamassery, the company has not received a single rupee as compensation till date. In a letter dated March 16, Kochi Metro had asked the company to hand over the remaining 93 cents of land to start construction of the parking area for the Metro station.As per the agreement for sale of land executed between <ORG>APOLLO TYRES LIMITED.</ORG> operated <ORG>5ce4c41d8c5a90d84966fdfc</ORG> and Ernakulam District Collector on September 3, 2014, the company is entitled to get a total compensation of Rs 29.36 crore for 1.53 acre land acquired for the Kochi Metro project.Following this, two D-form cheques dated September 18, 2014 for a total sum of Rs 23.26 crore as 80 per cent of the sale consideration were given to the company. Then company handed over 62.22 cents of land.However, the cheques were not honoured on September 18, 2014 as ways and means clearance from finance department is pending. As the matter was kept pending by the government for a long time, we had to approach the Kerala High Court through a writ petition on December 15, 2014 praying for suitable directions to the government to release the payment.The High Court judgment on March 21, 2016 directed the government to find out whether any reversionary right is vested with the government in the said land. Though the Kerala government had acquired 31.38 acre of land and handed it to us, we paid the entire amount on account of acquisition charges. The government order no. 127 on February 16, 1962 assigned the land to us. We have the possession certificate with us and have been paying land tax since then, said C <PER>KOTTUKAPPALLIL THOMAS TOM</PER>, Unit Head, <ORG>APOLLO TYRES LIMITED.</ORG> Kalamassery plant.<PER>KOTTUKAPPALLIL THOMAS TOM</PER> pointed out that in 1991 an extent of 0.9 hectares of land for National Highway widening and in 1966 an extent of 0.1497 hectares of land for railways were acquired from the company by the government after paying it required compensation.When contacted, the official spokesperson of Kochi Metro said issues related to land acquisition are dealt by the Revenue Department and the final decision regarding compensation to <ORG>APOLLO TYRES LIMITED.</ORG> should be taken by them.When contacted Shajahan, Deputy Collector (LA), Kochi Metro passed the buck to the Finance Department. At present we cant do anything in this regard. The cheque we have issued to the company needed a ways and means clearance from the Finance Department. They issued an objection regarding the clearance of the cheque to the treasury. The Finance Department is the sole authority and we can not issue anymore cheque. Meanwhile, a case is pending before the High Court in this regard. Hence anything associated with issue can be taken up only with the direction of the Revenue or the Finance Department, said the Deputy Collector.<PER>KOTTUKAPPALLIL THOMAS TOM</PER> said Additional Chief Secretary had convened a meeting in Thiruvananthapuram in this regard last week. At the meeting we came to know that a Government Order will be issued in this regard. Since the deadline to submit a report before the High Court will be expiring this week, we think the maters will not be delayed anymore, said Shajahan said.

 593ba96a7be9e001470aa10c After diamonds, now it is time for jewellery of all kinds to glitter. <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e33</PER> manufacturing in India, which dates back over 2,000 years, is being given an impetus to enable India emerge as a leading exporter of gold and diamond jewellery in the world. , Prime Minister <PER>5ce4c3018c5a90d84964332b</PER>, in <PER>5ce4c3018c5a90d84964332b</PER> visit last week to the diamond city of Surat, reiterated <PER>5ce4c3018c5a90d84964332b</PER> vision to make India the gems & jewellery hub of the world.Enough of just diamond cutting and polishing work. Now we have to be number one in gems & jewellery, not only in Make in India but Designed in India jewellery in the world, <PER>5ce4c3018c5a90d84964332b</PER> said.The diamond cutting & polishing industry may be only 60 to 70 years old in India but the country has established its dominancein the global market. Today, 12 out of 14 diamonds sold in the world are polished or cut in India. In value terms, India has 60% market share in the global diamond market and in volume it is 90%.The aim of the government now is to have India corner more than 50% of the jewellery exports market currently dominated by manufacturers from Italy, Turkey, Germany and Hong Kong.The government has asked the industry to draw up a roadmap to boost exports and has assured all help including skill development of artisans and jewellery manufacturing. Skills become critical as the global market demands fashion jewellery, unlike heavily fabricated jewellery which are in demand from customers in India and people of Indian origin.Skill development startsThe skill development process has already started. Then the next phase would be infrastructure development, said <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e2e</PER>, <ORG>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e2c</ORG> and convener of Gold Panel of Gems & Jewellery Exports Promotion Council (GJEPC), the commerce ministry body responsible to boost gem and jewellery exports.Once that is done, jewellery exports will increase. Today we are not exporting much as we lack the capability to manufacture designs foreigners want, <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e2e</PER> said,Indian manufacturers have the expertise to make 22 and 20 carat gold jewellery but exports market demand jewellery that are made of 8 or 10 carat gold.Buyers in the U.S., the biggest exports market for jewellery, are fashion oriented and buy lightweight jewellery that does not cost much.So India needs to go for large scale production of jewellery through machines to cater to the global demand.For that we need to set up common manufacturing facility as every jeweller does not have money. Besides, we need to increase our ability to understand the fashion trends of foreign buyers and come up with designs that they would like, <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e2e</PER> said.<ORG>RAJESH EXPORTS LIMITED</ORG>d849736b2b</ORG>, Indias largest jewellery exporter exports about 150 tonnes of jewellery a year. The company said an export push would benefit the industry.<PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e33</PER> exports from India are growing by 5-10% a year and the idea to promote jewellery exports is very good, said <PER>PIYUSH TRIKAMLAL MEHTA</PER>, Chief Strategist, <ORG>RAJESH EXPORTS LIMITED</ORG>Never too lateIndia has a strong base in jewellery manufacturing and a lot of workers are engaged in this business. We should have encouraged jewellery exports a long time ago because our strength has been in jewellery making for ages. Manufacturing and exports of other sectors were more recent, <PER>PIYUSH TRIKAMLAL MEHTA</PER> added.The global retail jewellery market is estimated at 2,900 tonnes per year and Indian and China are the biggest consumers. In the exports market, the U.S., Europe and UAE are the biggest followed by Japan and Australia.<PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e31</PER>, CEO, <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e33</PER> and past chairman of the GJEPC said, For us sky is the limit. We are now developing the managerial skills of people to run the factories. We are also training workers for the same.The <ORG>5ce4c30b8c5a90d849644c64</ORG> (<ORG>5ce4c30b8c5a90d849644c64</ORG>) located in Mumbai is being strengthened for capacity building and skill development across India.It is opening two more branches in Varanasi and Udupi to support jewellery making in those areas. It is also increasing the student intake to help India achieve the desired objective in the jewellery business.  In jewellery we are meeting around 10% of the global demand. We want to achieve 60-70% share. Hong Kong is famous for studded jewellery, Italy is famous for plain gold jewellery. We have the capability to manufacturing and supply both these types. Easily we can increase out share to 30% within five years, <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e31</PER> said.GJEPC data shows most of the plain gold jewellery was exported to Malaysia followed by exports to the UAE, Singapore and the U.K. In 2016, most of the studded jewellery was exported to France and the US.Industry insiders said jewellery exports could not achieve full potential due to apathy of successive governments.India did not give any attention to the jewellery sector all these years, said <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e30</PER>, past president of Gem & Jewellery Federation.We are selling jewellery to countries where Indians are there. We never tried selling much to an American or a German in a big way. The market has tremendous potential, <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e30</PER> said.<PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e30</PER> added that the government must support the industry. There has to be ease of doing business. Today, it is a nightmare to export a shipment of jewellery. It is not the same with diamonds. The amount of documentation that takes place deters people from export, <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e30</PER> said.Foreigners go to Dubai and find out about India. When they go to Gold Souk in Dubai, 90% of the jewellery is from India, the people selling jewellery are Indians. But the credit goes to UAE and not to India. UAE could turn Dubai into the city of Gold but not India which had everything in its favour, <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e30</PER> said. <PER>5ce4cbb98c5a90d8497b3e33</PER> exports to the UAE in 2016 were close to $5,527 million compared with the U.S. to which exports amounted to about $1,676 million.Export strategyIndian exporters have prepared an export promotion strategy and a target of $60 billion worth of gems and jewellery exports in five years, from last years $35 billion which included over $22 billion from exports of cut & polished diamond.We have set a jewellery exports target of $60 billion by 2022 in a detailed vision document. Apart from generic promotion, we would focus on hand-crafted jewellery and value addition to achieve the target, said <PER>5ce4c4368c5a90d8496740de</PER>, chairman, GJEPC.In their revised strategy, Indian diamond exporters are planning to reduce exports of cut and polished diamond pieces and focus more on shipment of value-added products which include studded jewellery.Apart from the Middle East, European and American markets are reviving which is a good sign to achieve higher export growth. So, we are aiming at higher exports through value addition, brand promotion and re-orientation of rough diamond import strategy through its auction sale in India, said <PER>5ce4c9b78c5a90d84975f60b</PER>, executive director, GJEPC.Currently, Indian jewellery manufacturers are primarily shipping out unbranded products to overseas importers ,who then tag these products with their own brand and charge a premium from buyers. Indian jewellers are now planning to shift from unbranded to branded jewellery for higher value realisation.GJEPC, with the help of the commerce ministry, is setting up a gold craft and design institute at Udupi in Karnataka to reskill local artisans.The institute, which is aimed at reviving manufacturing activity in Dakshina Kannada cluster, will have a common facility centre to help artisans of the Udupi region work with state-of-art machines in the jewellery sector.Similarly, a jewellery park is being planned in Mumbai and also in the offing is a university for ,ewellery.However, it is no easy job. A leading jeweller said, The PM wishes that we should focus more on exports than the domestic sector. It is just like asking a Kirana to get into exports. It is not that easy. The dynamics are different. A jeweller is essentially a Kirana store and a massive transformation is required to achieve the goal.

By March 2018, this energy-line of 20.99 km connecting Balram, Bharatpur, Jagannath, Ananta, Bhubaneswari and Lingaraj projects directly to National Highway (NH-200) will be converted to 10.5 metres wide pucca road with one and a half metres of concrete pavement on either side, <PER>SHANTINATH JHA</PER> added.The average pollution index has shown a significant drop in Talcher after the coal-laden vehicles were diverted to the corridor, the <ORG>MAHANADI COALFIELDS LIMITED</ORG> claimed.

(Source: Reuters/Huseyin Aldemir) People demonstrate outside Ataturk international airport during an attempted coup in Istanbul, Turkey, July 16, 2016. (Source: Reuters/Huseyin Aldemir)The attempted military coup in Turkey could hamper the United States in its war against Islamic State in Syria and undermine other US goals in the Middle East by weakening democracy and sparking prolonged instability in the NATO pacts only Muslim member.With the Turkish military and security services apparently split as gunfire and explosions rocked both Istanbul and the capital Ankara on Friday night, the United States made clear it was siding with the government of President <PER>5ce4c4118c5a90d84966dcbf</PER>.Relations between Erdogans government and the US administration have been rocky, but <PER>5ce4c4118c5a90d84966dcbf</PER> has broadly cooperated in the fight against Islamic State.The United States views with gravest concern events unfolding in Turkey, Secretary of State <PER>5ce4c3078c5a90d8496442a7</PER> said on Friday. <PER>5ce4c4118c5a90d84966dcbf</PER> later stressed Washingtons absolute support for the democratically elected government during a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister <PER>5ce4c3a08c5a90d84965bd2e</PER>.Watch Video: Whats making newsWhatever the outcome, analysts said, the US ally now faces a period of political and economic instability. That could divert the Turkish military and security services from stemming a recent series of attacks blamed on Islamic State, fighting a Kurdish insurrection and shutting off the flow of foreign militants across its border to and from Syria.From the US perspective, the worst case scenario might be an ineffective coup that pitches Turkey into a prolonged power struggle, said <PER>5ce4c6168c5a90d8496c2703</PER>, the national security director at the Bipartisan Policy Center.Even a quickly executed coup which met little resistance would be destabilizing, but a partial or unsuccessful coup would lead to much more instability ahead.Turkey, the bridge between Europe and the Middle East, has NATOs second-largest army after that of the United States, and is the regions largest economy. Despite a history of military coups, the country of 75 million people is the regions oldest democracy, and has helped provide stability in southeastern Europe and the Middle East.This could be one of the most critical challenges of the Obama administration. A stable Turkey is crucial to American interests in the Middle East, the Balkans and the Caucasus, said <PER>JEFFRY BRUCE SEIDEL</PER>, of the <ORG>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> and a former CIA analyst. A democratic Turkey, even if flawed, is essential to any hopes of political reform in the Middle East.Turkey is host to important US and NATO military facilities. They include Incirlik Air Base, from which US fighters and drones hit Islamic State in neighboring Syria, a CIA base from which the agency has been supporting moderate Syrian rebel forces, US listening posts and an early warning radar for NATOs European missile defense system.Turkey was scheduled to attend a meeting near Washington next week of the US-led anti-Islamic State coalition, although it was unclear if the attempted coup would affect that.US officials have criticized Erdogans increasing authoritarianism, Turkeys support for Islamist opposition groups fighting Syrian President <PER>5ce4c31b8c5a90d849646f67</PER> and the slow pace in sealing its border with Syria to foreign fighters.For <PER>5ce4c31b8c5a90d849646f67</PER> part, <PER>5ce4c4118c5a90d84966dcbf</PER> has been angered by US support for Syrian Kurds fighting Islamic State that <PER>5ce4c4118c5a90d84966dcbf</PER> considers allies of the PKK, the rebel group fighting for greater autonomy for Turkeys Kurds.The key point is, the (Obama) administration would always support a democratically elected government in this situation, said <PER>5ce4c6168c5a90d8496c2704</PER>, a former US ambassador to Azerbaijan and a former senior White House adviser on Turkey.US interests will suffer no matter the outcome of the coup attempt, said <PER>5ce4c6168c5a90d8496c2705</PER>, director of the Center for Turkish Studies at the Middle East Institute. If the coup fails, Erdogans hand will be strengthened and well see more of <PER>5ce4c6168c5a90d8496c2705</PER> autocratic agenda, <PER>5ce4c6168c5a90d8496c2705</PER> said. And if it succeeds, this means . . . further instability for Turkey domestically.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now

 58fca3817be9e0580d5daf8a Unilever plc, the Anglo-Dutch global fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant, announced the closing of the open offer to increase its stake in Indian subsidiary Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL).The offer commenced on June 21, and closed on July 4. HUL shareholders tendered 319,699,278 shares during the tender period at the offer price of Rs.600 per share. This values the transaction at about Rs.19,180 crore or 2.45 billion pounds, a statement from Unilever said.Based on the shares tendered which represent 14.8 per cent of HUL, Unilevers stake would go up from 52.48 per cent to 67.28 per cent.In response, on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday, HUL share opened 3.5 per cent higher at Rs.622.05, moved to a 52-week high of Rs.631.95 and closed at Rs.609.15; up 1.4 per cent from the previous close.We are pleased to have received such a good response to our voluntary open offer and that, as a result, we will significantly increase our stake in HUL, an excellent Indian business with a proud heritage and the potential for attractive long-term growth, <PER>5ce4c3d08c5a90d849663105</PER>, CEO, Unilever, said in a statement.Unilever will announce details of final acceptance after verification of shares tendered on July 11, and the payment will be completed in a week thereafter.<PER>5ce4c3d08c5a90d849663104</PER>, Analyst, Private Client Group Kotak Securities, said Unilever would be fairly satisfied with the response.It is a higher tendering than was speculated some time ago as many thought the offer was not generous enough. There were doubts whether there would be enough interest.The offer announced was considered path-breaking as Unilever was the majority owner and the intention to increase its stake by a third was a sign that India is very important for them in the long-term, said <PER>SONAM KATYAL</PER>, Head, Research, <ORG>IDBI CAPITAL MARKET SERVICES LIMITED</ORG>.

 593d3f7b7be9e00dabcbe8ad Raw cashew prices will ease in 2012 feel cashew kernel exporters as traders have substantial holdings and also due to the arrival of East African crop.Traders in Africa are holding between 40,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes of raw cashew and supplies from Tanzania are expected to counter any crunch situation in the New Year, said <PER>KRISHAN LAL KATYAL</PER>, Chairman, <ORG>CASHEW EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL OF INDIA</ORG>. <PER>KRISHAN LAL KATYAL</PER> said that raw cashew prices were forced up by a squeeze in supplies owing to the civil war in Ivory Coast, which ended in May. As a result of the civil war, supplies from the West African country were delayed and were still available in the market.However, it does not appear to be a lag on Indian cashew kernel exports in the New Year.Ivory Coast continued to be the biggest supplier of raw cashew for Indian processors, followed by Benin and Tanzania. The trio of African countries accounted for more than three lakh tonnes of raw cashew exports to India worth Rs.1,633 crore. Import of raw cashew totalled more than five lakh tonnes worth Rs.2,479 crore during 2010-11. Figures from <ORG>CASHEW EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL OF INDIA</ORG> reveal that cashew kernel export from India went up by nearly 60 per cent in quantity between April and August this year to 65,501 tonnes from 41,395 tonnes during the same period in 2010. The increase in quantity was reflected in value too as total export earnings stood at Rs.1,737 crore, an increase of more than 56 per cent compared to the April-August period in 2010. Dollar earnings went up from $239 million to $384 million, an increase of 61 per cent.Exporters also felt that cashew did not face serious threat from other nuts because cashew, despite a rise in dollar value, offered value for money as other nuts such as pistachios, were costlier.The calendar year saw cashew kernel price rise to $4.50 a pound for a short period before Diwali. It has since eased and is expected to be firm around $3.50 a pound.In the past, cashew has proved to be counter-recessionary and exporters do not feel that <PER>KRISHAN LAL KATYAL</PER> of nuts face a serious slackening of demand because of slowdown in Europe and the U.S.

 593ac46a7be9e079df24b7f7 The Bombay Stock Exchange sensitive index, Sensex, lost 315.69 points to close below the 17000-mark at 16990.18 as stock markets tumbled world-over on fears of weakening global economy on downgrading of the U.S. sovereign rating by the rating agency, Standard and Poor's (S&P), last Friday.In intra-day, the index tumbled by 546 points. However, it recovered after Finance Minister <PER>5ce4c3028c5a90d849643669</PER> said that India was better prepared than many others to handle the crisis situation and its fundamentals continued to remain strong.The broad-based National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty dipped below the 5100-level before closing with a loss of 92.75 points at 5118.50.S&P, one of the three U.S. credit rating agencies has downgraded the U.S. rating from AAA to AA+, joining Belgium and New Zealand. The other two agencies affirmed AAA after the debt ceiling deal. As was expected, capital markets globally reacted negatively on Monday.I do see the downgrade as bad news but not for the obvious reasons. To me the ratings agencies are inadvertently playing a pernicious role in worsening the global policy response to the private sector debt crisis, said <PER>5ce4c80f8c5a90d8497168a2</PER>, Director of Asset Allocation, Fidelity, a leading investment firm.The manner in which financial markets and governments react over the next few weeks will determine how the prevailing fragilities in the global sovereign and financial sectors play out. This, in turn, will impact the trajectory of global growth. Should global growth weaken further, India will be impacted, said <PER>5ce4c49d8c5a90d849684fd4</PER>, a leading domestic rating agency.Partly mitigating factors are the easing of pressures on global crude and commodity prices. Moreover, Indian corporates are likely to be cushioned by a primarily domestic-focussed economy and strong balance sheets.Impact on IndiaImpact on Indian equities would be negative in the short-term. India already suffers from high inflation and weakening economy.However, it is positioned well as compared to other economies for this kind of eventuality.While growth rate may be slowing, it is still expected to be over 7 per cent.We expect policy to refocus on growth as low growth is a also a cause for ratings to be suspect (lower growth means low buoyancy in government finances), said <PER>DAMODAR H SEJPAL</PER>, CEO, <ORG>ASK INVESTMENT MANAGERS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>.

 5903cbff7be9e02646bd80a7 Mumbai, Aug 24, 2015 (PTI) 18:08 ISTIn the bloodiest carnage on Dalal Street, the stock market benchmark Sensex today crashed by 1,624.51 points -- its biggest single-day fall -- and over Rs 7 lakh crore got wiped out within hours from the investors' wealth on a sharp global sell-off triggered by a Chinese rout.The index ended the day 5.94 per cent down at 25,741.56 points as jittery investors sold shares across all sectors including energy, banking, auto, IT, infrastructure and real estate, even as Finance Minister <PER>5ce4c8618c5a90d84972459c</PER> and RBI Governor <PER>5ce4c4bd8c5a90d84968a244</PER> sought to soothe the frayed nerves saying fundamentals of Indian markets remain strong.The rupee was also not untouched by the carnage, which hit a fresh two-year low of 66.66 versus the US dollar, hitting the investors' appetite hard.The downfall began right at the word go when markets opened this morning and the BSE's 30-share index fell by as much as 1,741.35 points in the intra-day before recouping a small portion of the losses.In percentage terms also, the full-day loss was biggest in six and half years since a 7.25 per cent plunge on January 7, 2009. In terms of intra-day fall, today's plunge is highest in over seven years since a 2,062-point rout on January 21, 2008. Overall, this was the third-highest intra-day fall.Sentiment also took a knock after crude oil prices softened to multi-year lows amid deepening concerns about weak Chinese growth and global oversupply.The total investor wealth, measured in terms of cumulative market value of all listed stocks, tanked by more than Rs 7 lakh crore and crashed below Rs 100-lakh crore mark to end the day at Rs 95,33,105 crore.Though notional in nature, promoters of listed companies accounted for over half of these losses at about Rs 4 lakh crore while foreign investors also took a hit of close to Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The loss in the accounts of retail investors is estimated at about Rs 75,000 crore while institutional investors also took a hit of about Rs 1 lakh crore.The broader 50-share NSE Nifty was no exception and witnessed heavy selling pressure and plunged 490.95 points to end the day at 7,809, down 5.92 per cent. The BSE small-cap and mid-cap indices plunged even more by 8.81 and 7.68 per cent, respectively."The two important factors which led to today's chaos are the sharp fall in the rupee due to the increase in risk to emerging market currencies and the high demand for the Offer for Sale of state-run Indian Oil requiring a total outflow of Rs 9,400 crore," said <PER>PADMA VINOD BETAI</PER>, Head, Fundamental Research, <ORG>GEOJIT BNP PARIBAS FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED</ORG>.Kotak Securities' Dipen Shah said the global risk-off trade has impacted Indian equity markets also, but added that there were some positive longer-term takeaways, including the plunge in crude prices to USD 44 per barrel.Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 8.49 per cent tracking a weaker US market. European markets dropped too in the opening trade amid the fierce global sell-off.Foreign portfolio investors net sold shares worth Rs 2,340.60 crore on Friday, as per provisional data.In terms of full-day loss, this is only the second instance when the Sensex has closed the day with a plunge of over 1,000 points -- the first being a 1,408.35 points crash on January 21, 2008.On intra-day basis, this was the eighth time when Sensex suffered a loss of over 1,000 points while the first seven such instances took place during 2008."An end to this cascade will depend on the likelihood of an immediate RBI intervention to support the rupee. An end to the further downgrade in emerging market economies will specifically depend on China," added <PER>PADMA VINOD BETAI</PER>.

GSAM India has a strong bouquet of schemes and a talented team. We are confident that together they will complement and enhance RCAMs overall offerings to our investors," said <PER>SOUMEN GHOSH</PER>, Executive Director, <ORG>RELIANCE CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT LIMITED</ORG>.Goldman Sachs India Chairman <PER>5ce4c85b8c5a90d849723b52</PER> said, "<ORG>5ce4c4468c5a90d8496768fe</ORG> will continue to deliver global asset management services to Indian clients and will remain a significant investor in Indian securities through regional and global managed <ORG>5ce4c4468c5a90d8496768fe</ORG> funds."In the meantime, we remain committed to growing our investment banking and securities franchise in India and we continue to feel extremely positive about India as an important and growing market for Goldman Sachs overall."<ORG>RELIANCE CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT LIMITED</ORG> CEO <PER>5ce4c4468c5a90d8496768fd</PER> said the deal will add over half a percent to its market share."We will ensure that we maintain seamless continuity for all GSAM India fund investors across all schemes. Going forward we would be willing to consider more such acquisitions that add to our strength and complement our portfolio," <PER>5ce4c4468c5a90d8496768fd</PER> added."We feel this business is best positioned to achieve long-term success under the direction of an asset manager with an established onshore franchise. We are deeply encouraged by the growing investor demand and Government support for the burgeoning Indian ETF industry," said <PER>5ce4c4498c5a90d8496771f1</PER>, Co-Chief Executive Officer, GSAM India.GSAM India currently manages 12 mutual fund schemes, including 10 ETF schemes, and is the largest ETF provider in India.

 5903e6427be9e02646bd9347 Stop politicising FDI in retail, look for bigger benefits: CIILast updated: 28 November, 2011New Delhi, Nov 28, (IANS) : 18:47 ISTUrging opposition parties and state governments to stop politicising the issue of foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail, a leading industry body said Monday that allowing global players in the sector will create more jobs and benefit consumers."People should stop giving it a political overtone and look for it with the benefit of view to their state, their labour in terms of employment and of course the benefit it offers to the consumers at large," <PER>5ce4c8938c5a90d84972cb72</PER>, chief executive officer, <ORG>5ce4c6f38c5a90d8496e6b1d</ORG> told reporters on the sidelines of a <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG> event here.The <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG> (<ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG>) said allowing foreign equity would help organised retail grow to $260 billion by 2020.According to <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG>, the move would increase income of producers across sectors by $35-45 billion per year, create 3-4 million jobs with the retail chains and 4-6 million jobs in the logistics sector, other than creating a demand for more contract labour in distribution and repackaging centres and functions such as housekeeping and security."People should take a much larger view of this and look at it for what benefit it offers to the country, states and to the people of the states, what happens to consumers and their daily lives in terms of their ability to combat inflation and get on with their lives," added <PER>5ce4c8938c5a90d84972cb72</PER> who also the heads <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG>'s national committee on retail.The cabinet's decision to open up multi-brand retail has led to a furore with political parties and even a key ally like the Trinamool Congress putting the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government on the mat.Both houses of parliament were adjourned for the day Monday as a united opposition stalled the day's proceedings protesting the move of the government."Let's look at it from an economy perception not from political view," said <PER>CHANDRAJIT BANERJEE</PER>, <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG> director general.Political parties have been opposing the reform saying it will wipe out the small retailer. Various trader associations are also against it."Being an Indian retailer, I can tell that a lot of these concerns are misplaced. We have seen in the last five years that not a single kirana store has ever shut down. A lot of these concerns are exaggerated and misplaced," said <PER>5ce4c8938c5a90d84972cb72</PER>.

DAS, FARIDABAD, 2015, Reuters: 11:46 ISTMillions of unsuspecting Indian farmers are spraying fake pesticides onto their fields, contaminating soil, cutting crop yields and putting both food security and human health at risk in the country of 1.25 billion people.The use of spurious pesticides has exacerbated losses in the genetically modified (GM) cotton crop in northern India after an attack by whitefly, a pest, say officials. If unchecked, some of India's roughly $26 billion in annual farm exports could be hit.Made secretly and given names that sometimes resemble the original, counterfeits account for up to 30 percent of the $4 billion pesticide market, according to a government-endorsed study.And they are gaining market share in what is the world's No.4 pesticide maker and sixth biggest exporter.Influential dealers in small towns peddle high-margin fake products to gullible farmers, in turn hurting established firms like Syngenta, <ORG>5ce4c4ef8c5a90d84969261c</ORG>, DuPont, BASF, PI Industries, <ORG>5ce4c56b8c5a90d8496a7637</ORG> and <ORG>5ce4c4cd8c5a90d84968c9e7</ORG>."We are illiterate farmers; we seek advice from the vendor and just spray on the crop," said <PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d6</PER>, a farmer in Punjab's Bathinda region, whose three-acre (1.2-hectare) GM cotton crop was damaged by whitefly this year."It's a double loss when you see the crop wilting away and your money is spent on pesticides that don't work."But <PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d0</PER>, who heads India's top pesticide testing laboratory in Faridabad, near Delhi, said farmers panic at the first sight of a pest attack.As a result, they overuse chemicals, reducing their effectiveness and raising costs.<PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d0</PER>'s team worked overtime after Punjab sent nearly 1,000 samples of suspect pesticides following the whitefly outbreak, finding some to be falsely labelled.Indian officials tested nearly 50,000 pesticide samples last fiscal year, finding around 3 percent of them "misbranded", <PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d0</PER> said.<PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d0</PER> added the government was increasing inspections and looking to increase penalties, including jail terms of up to 10 years.TOXIC RACKETLax laws, which punish by revoking licences or imposing short jail terms for offenders, and staffing shortages compromise efforts to track and seize substandard products.Toxic pesticides that are banned abroad continue, meanwhile, to be sold freely in India.India still permits the use of monocrotophos, a pesticide blamed for the death of 23 children in Bihar in 2013 after they ate contaminated free school lunches. That tragedy prompted the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations to advise developing countries to phase out such chemicals."Use of excessive pesticides has been a cause for concern for quite some time," said <PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d1</PER>, FAO's India representative. "Now if they turn out to be spurious it's a cause for even greater worry."Chronic exposure to pesticides can lead to depression, a factor in suicides, <PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d1</PER> said. Pesticides can also cause cancer.In recent years the European Union and Saudi Arabia temporarily stopped buying some vegetables from India after finding pesticide residues in produce. Indian officials say such cases result from the overuse of chemicals.RAPID GROWTH IN FAKESIndia's fake pesticide industry is expanding at 20 percent per year while the overall market is growing at 12 percent."We know that a racket is going on," said <PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d4</PER>, an assistant director general of Indian Council of Agricultural Research. "But it is only when suspicion arises that people go to inspect."<PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d4</PER> also said illegal chemicals are imported "under the garb of good material", and that there was a "definite risk" of some fake pesticides being exported from India, although there was no evidence yet."Theoretically it becomes a risk, but practically there are checks and balances," said <PER>GANTAKOLLA SRIVASTAVA</PER>, CEO of <ORG>CROPLIFE INDIA</ORG>, an association of the top pesticide companies operating in the country.KNOCK OFFSKarnataka state authorities this month seized large stocks of "Korajen", an illegal copy of DuPont's Coragen used to kill rice pests. Police are investigating similar cases elsewhere, DuPont said.Punjab has also filed police cases against fake pesticide makers and arrested a senior official at its agriculture university for allowing the sale of counterfeits.Apart from counterfeiting, India is also grappling with rising cases of unmonitored chemicals passed off as herbal pesticides, said <PER>GANTAKOLLA SRIVASTAVA</PER>.India loses about 4 percent, or over 10 million tonnes, of food output a year due to fake pesticides, said the government-backed study."There has been a trend of increasing consumption of (fake)products as against the regular ones," said <PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d7</PER> of Tata Strategic Management Group that conducted the study."All stakeholders should be worried ... it's going to hit food security."Last year spurious fungicides cut apple production in Jammu & Kashmir state, while farming lobbyists have linked recent farmer suicides in Odisha to fake pesticides.Some producers say they have been wrongly targeted by government laboratories. Coromandel Agrico, for example, was accused of selling falsely labelled products.Tests that found it selling pesticides in incorrect dosages were inaccurate, said <PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d5</PER>, the company's regulatory affairs officer."We will not take the risk of selling sub-standard products," <PER>5ce4c7248c5a90d8496ef0d5</PER> said. "The problem is at the dealer/distributor level. Similar sounding products are made, mixed, sold."

HIMANSHU AGGARWAL 	 ASPIRING MINDS ASSESSMENT PRIVATE LIMITED 
 58fba8967be9e0581df4a4ae CHENNAI: Every year IT companies report massive hiring numbers in Tamil Nadu which dwarf any recruitment taking place in the rest of the country. But is Tamil Nadu really the hub of employable graduates in the true sense? An employability survey admits that TN is a hub with regards to total number of engineering graduates but rates it far behind other states in terms of the percentage of candidates who can be considered employable. Interestingly, Delhi and Bihar come out on top."The strong correlation of poor employability to the number of colleges in a state show how states are concentrating on quantity rather than quality," said <PER>HIMANSHU AGGARWAL</PER>, CEO of <ORG>ASPIRING MINDS ASSESSMENT PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, a Gurgaon-based firm which conducted this survey. States with a higher percentage of government engineering colleges such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal fared better in the survey than states such as TN and Andhra Pradesh where private colleges have mushroomed. Total number of engineering colleges in TN is 600 and in Andhra Pradesh, 750.The firm conducted a nationwide written test AMCAT which assessed candidates on communication skills, problem-solving and programming, and based their findings on the employability scores gathered through it. It was conducted across 20 states and 1.2 lakh final year engineering students.

 58ff46337be9e04136164445 New Delhi, June 17, 2015 (IANS) 15:46 ISTThe state-run processed foods giant <ORG>MOTHER DAIRY FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> on Wednesday said its milk is safe for consumption and the two samples that were found to be sub-standard were drawn before these could be taken to its factories for quality tests and processing."It is unfortunate that loose milk samples, collected at village level and yet to be accepted for processing at our factory, allegedly did not pass the tests of the Uttar Pradesh Food and Drugs Administration," said <PER>Shri S PARTHASARATHY</PER>, <ORG>MOTHER DAIRY FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> managing director."The milk sample reported has been drawn even before reaching the chilling centre where the first level of testing happens to ascertain the quality of milk for further processing," <PER>Shri S PARTHASARATHY</PER> told a press conference here.<PER>Shri S PARTHASARATHY</PER> also said it was unfair to link the samples tested by the food safety authority, that were not processed, to the company. "This erodes the confidence of the consumer."The press meet was called to explain the company's stand after two samples of <ORG>MOTHER DAIRY FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> milk were taken and one of them tested positive for detergents. <PER>5ce4c7368c5a90d8496f24ab</PER>, chief of the food safety body in Agra, said they were drawn from collection centres near Agra in November 2014."The samples were sent to the Lucknow lab which declared both of them substandard. The company challenged the results and demanded the samples be sent to the Kolkata lab which too found them defective. The Kolkata lab found one sample contained detergent," <PER>5ce4c7368c5a90d8496f24ab</PER> told IANS on Tuseday.<PER>Shri S PARTHASARATHY</PER> said the future course of action was being decided."We haven't received the tests from Kolkata lab yet, and we shall work with the food regulatory authority regarding the issue," <PER>Shri S PARTHASARATHY</PER> said.<PER>Shri S PARTHASARATHY</PER> also sought to explain the process and said milk is first pooled from farmers and then sent to chilling centres through tankers. Every can is then distilled and processed with four levels of thorough testing -- at input, processing, dispatch and even after they reach the market."As a responsible organisation we follow 100 percent testing protocol, not random testing."Added <PER>5ce4c3a68c5a90d84965c601</PER>, the company's operations head: "For the past 45 years we have been following the same food safety procedures before they reach the market. We check for quality levels even after the products are in the market to ensure that the product available is safe for consumption."Answering a question if there was any testing done at the collection centres, <PER>Shri S PARTHASARATHY</PER> said the mechanisms are still being developed by its parent organisation, National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), with the company's own team to detect adulteration at that stage itself.<PER>Shri S PARTHASARATHY</PER> said the company does not want the consumer confidence to be lost.The NDDB-owned <ORG>MOTHER DAIRY FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> supplies more than 35 lakh litres of milk everyday. The milk is processed in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan.

 59033b467be9e02646bd2453 Infosys team coming to break Rajarhat deadlock: MinisterKolkata, Mar 30, 2013, (IANS) : 18:13 ISTIn an apparent move to break the deadlock over its stalled project in West Bengal, IT major Infosys is sending a delegation to West Bengal to find a way to resolve the issue, Industry Minister <PER>5ce4c3a48c5a90d84965c182</PER> said Saturday.The proposed project of the IT bellwether firm at Rajarhat in the eastern fringes of the city has failed to take off as the Mamata Banerjee government has been refusing to grant it special economic zone (SEZ) status or attribute a similar status to it."A delegation from Infosys will come here. We will then find out the way to resolve the issue," <PER>5ce4c3a48c5a90d84965c182</PER> said on the sidelines of the annual regional meeting of <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG> (<ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG>) here.The Bangalore-headquartered IT major, however, did not specify that when it would send its delegation to the state."I have already talked to (Infosys co-chairman S.) <PER>Shri M GOPALAKRISHNA</PER>. We want that the company starts operations here. The West Bengal government will fully cooperate with it," <PER>5ce4c3a48c5a90d84965c182</PER> said.The minister said <PER>5ce4c3a48c5a90d84965c182</PER> government would assist the firm in all possible ways but it could not give a SEZ status to the Rajarhat project as it had promised to the people that it was not going to give such status to any project in the state.Infosys has been demanding the SEZ status for its project, to be developed on a 50-acre land, over the last three years.The company, however, maintained that it would continue to have "discussions" with the state government on solving the impasse."I will come back and discuss it with the minister (<PER>5ce4c3a48c5a90d84965c182</PER>) to take a decision on taking it (the project) forward," said <PER>Shri M GOPALAKRISHNA</PER>, who was also present at the <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG> event.Asked when <PER>Shri M GOPALAKRISHNA</PER> would hold talks with the minister, <PER>Shri M GOPALAKRISHNA</PER> said: "I don't have any timeframe."

In 2008 we commissioned the airport and started working with airlines to bring in connectivity to tier 1 and II cities, which is our catchment area," said <PER>VIKRAM RUPCHAND JAISINGHANI</PER>, CEO, <ORG>GMR HYDERABAD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT LIMITED</ORG> to TOI when <PER>VIKRAM RUPCHAND JAISINGHANI</PER> was in the city recently.Launching the Fly by Hyderabad programme here, <PER>VIKRAM RUPCHAND JAISINGHANI</PER> said that RGIA brings in seamless connectivity and excellent transit facility. "Therefore a passenger who wants to get connected to national network will find Hyderabad airport a better proposition in terms of cost, comfort and time saving," <PER>VIKRAM RUPCHAND JAISINGHANI</PER> said.To buttress <PER>VIKRAM RUPCHAND JAISINGHANI</PER> point further, <PER>VIKRAM RUPCHAND JAISINGHANI</PER> said a person flying to Kolkata via Hyderabad from Mangalore will save an hour over Bangalore and nearly two hours via Mumbai. Similarly, <PER>VIKRAM RUPCHAND JAISINGHANI</PER> asserted that a trip to Delhi via Hyderabad will save an hour over Mumbai and nearly two hours via Bangalore.<ORG>GMR HYDERABAD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT LIMITED</ORG> CEO said the first phase of the airport, which has a capacity to handle 12 million passengers per annum, with a peak hour capacity of 3,200 passengers, may reach saturation in four years time, by which time the second phase would start to handle 20 million passengers."In terms of connectivity, Hyderabad almost on par with connectivity offered by Bangalore and Mumbai airports. Currently six domestic airlines are operating to 25 destinations in India and 12 international airlines and two domestic airlines are operating to 16 international destinations at the frequency of 128 international flights per week. Last year the overall traffic at Hyderabad Airport increased by 18% touching 7.63 million," <PER>VIKRAM RUPCHAND JAISINGHANI</PER> said claiming the year on year growth rate of Hyderabad Airport at 17.6% is higher than the growth rate of other major airports in India.<PER>VIKRAM RUPCHAND JAISINGHANI</PER> said the load factor in the direct service to Hyderabad from Mangalore, Spicejet, has touched 80% within a month of its launch.

TARANG MADANJIT MEHTA 	 INDIA BULLION AND JEWELLERS ASSOCIATION LIMITED 
 58fd402a7be9e06c93717fec MUMBAI: India's abolition of 500- and 1,000-rupee notes with virtually no warning caused confusion and concern among ordinary people and in sectors of the economy where cash is king, but banks and electronic payment services are among those licking their lips.Among the biggest losers from the shock move, aimed at flushing out money hidden from the tax man in India's huge shadow economy, is expected to be property, and the sharp drop in the sector's stocks on India's two main exchanges on Wednesday reflected that.It was better news for financial services companies involved in moving money around the formal economy, however, and among them was PayTM, India's top mobile payment wallet services provider.It said it saw a 200 percent jump in app downloads and a 1,000 percent increase in the amount of money added to its wallets since Prime Minister <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645cd4</PER>'s announcement of the curbs late on Tuesday.MobiKwik, which also offers mobile wallet services, said it saw a more than 40 percent increase in app downloads."We'll be a country with a lot more digital transactions and payments now," said <PER>5ce4c45a8c5a90d84967a3be</PER>, chief executive of PayTM, whose biggest shareholder is Alibaba Group.India's shadow, or "black", economy is estimated to be the size of about a fifth of its gross domestic product, with millions still having no access to formal financial services.Most financial transactions still happen in cash, although alternative payments and the use of cards have risen fast in recent years.Kotak Securities said it expected a large part of the shadow economy to become part of the formal economy, including the banking system, over time.Banks will benefit from higher savings deposits, while more financial savings also bodes well for insurance, mutual funds and wealth management companies, analysts said.Shares in top lender State Bank of India rose 2.9 percent on Wednesday on a Mumbai market that closed 1.3 percent lower. The banking sector index edged up 0.1 percent.Global card network providers Visa and MasterCard welcomed the Indian decision, saying it would help cashless transactions. PayPal Holdings Inc called it a "master stroke" to make India a less cash-reliant economy.PAIN FOR PROPERTY, GOLD, FOODThe crackdown on unaccounted wealth will put further pressure on the real estate sector, considered a safe haven for "black" money and already battling slower home sales.The impact will likely be felt by smaller developers and in the secondary sales market, making the real estate sector more illiquid for some time, said <PER>5ce4c4d08c5a90d84968d08c</PER>, managing director for India at consultant Cushman & Wakefield."Working capital needs for small and medium developers and other businesses will be a lot higher," said <PER>5ce4c4d08c5a90d84968d08c</PER>, adding that prices will correct in markets where substantial speculative investments have been made using unregistered cash.DLF Ltd, India's biggest listed property developer, slumped more than 17 percent in Mumbai trading on Wednesday, while the sector index fell 11.6 percent.A DLF spokesman, however, said the bank note move would not make "any big difference" for larger real estate companies who carried out transactions through banking channels."It is only a popular perception that real estate spawns black money, which is actually not true."The crackdown is also seen as negative for jewellers, as it could lower the demand for gold despite a short-term rush for the precious metal late on Tuesday, analysts said."Significant amounts of demand for gold used to get generated (by) unaccounted wealth," said <PER>TARANG MADANJIT MEHTA</PER>, Secretary at <ORG>INDIA BULLION AND JEWELLERS ASSOCIATION LIMITED</ORG>."Since such unaccounted money is set to lose value after the scrapping of 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee notes, demand for gold will also drop."<PER>TARANG MADANJIT MEHTA</PER> estimated India's gold demand would fall by 100-150 tonnes next year from an annual average of about 800 tonnes.The central bank will launch a new series of 500 and 2,000 rupee notes later this week.Other sectors that could be impacted in the short term due to shifts in demand include consumer goods and automobiles, <ORG>5ce4c3da8c5a90d849664dc0</ORG> said.Cement makers such as ACC and UltraTech will be hit, as 70 percent of demand comes from housing, <ORG>5ce4c3838c5a90d849657133</ORG> analysts said, adding that they expected cement companies to cut production.Food chain operators such as those run by <ORG>5ce4c4d08c5a90d84968d08a</ORG>, which operates the Domino's Pizza and Dunkin' Donuts chains in India, will also be temporarily affected as students mostly buy in cash, the brokerage added.

 58ff2ff57be9e0420db2e2a3  December air fare from Calcutta to Delhi: Rs 2,600 ? December air fare from Calcutta to Bangalore: Rs 3,500 A surfeit of new flights from Calcutta is dragging down domestic airfares from the city during winter, prompting industry watchers to predict a record plunge in December when the demand peaks. Airlines said as many as 20 more flights would be introduced on various domestic routes from Calcutta from November, a move aimed at consolidating market shares before competition hots up. Airfares to Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore are cheaper by at least Rs 1,000 on average in December than they are in November. On Thursday afternoon, the average Calcutta-Delhi fare for December was Rs 2,600. The Calcutta-Mumbai and Calcutta-Bangalore fares for the month were Rs 4,000 and Rs 3,500, respectively. Tour operators as well as officials of various airlines said the average fare to all these destinations used to be at least Rs 2,000 more on average even during lean seasons. Unlike earlier years, even the Diwali fares are not skyrocketing. The average Mumbai-Calcutta and Delhi-Calcutta fares for October 28 and 29 - Diwali is on October 30 - were around Rs 6,500 on Thursday. In contrast, the Diwali-eve airfare from Mumbai to Calcutta had soared to Rs 50,000 in 2012. "This year the fares are unlikely to go anywhere near that range," said <PER>5ce4c6558c5a90d8496cc328</PER>, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India. "The capacity now is much more than the demand even in the domestic sector in Calcutta and air fares will come down further in December as more flights are being introduced." Several tour operators said the domestic fares would plunge to the lowest level in several years in December, which is considered a peak travel season. Till October, the passenger footfall at Calcutta airport has increased by 10.9 per cent against a 31 per cent rise in the flight count compared with last year. Six of the new flights already introduced are IndiGo's. They are flying on the Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Guwahati and Bhubaneswar routes. Jet Airways will introduce three flights - two on the Delhi and one on the Bangalore routes - on October 31. SpiceJet will add six flights from November on the Silchar, Aizawl, Bagdogra, Visakhapatnam, Gorakhpur and Guwahati routes. GoAir is adding three flights. Air Asia India will come to Calcutta early next year, while Vistara has been operating three flights from the city. "We are definitely coming to Calcutta early next year," said <PER>PUNEET ABROL</PER>, <ORG>AIRASIA (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> CEO. Officials of the airline said they were planning to start with a flight to Delhi. Aviation experts said that by introducing more flights the airlines were trying to consolidate their market shares before more players fly in.

RAJESH SATISH MIRJANKAR 	 MSWIPE TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED 
 58fd36107be9e06c93717259 NEW DELHI: The demand for point of sale (POS) devices -- which saw a spurt after demonetisation as people and merchants opted for cashless transactions -- could be dented by the mandate to make them Aadhaar-enabled as this will push up costs and increase security risks, industry players said."One of the biggest challenges in making the POS machines Aadhaar-enabled is the high cost of adoption as well verifying its reliability. Tampering and skimming threats for merchants and processors of card data are on the rise," <PER>5ce4c4be8c5a90d84968a560</PER>, Chairman and Managing Director, <ORG>5ce4c4be8c5a90d84968a55e</ORG>68a55e</ORG>, told IANS.<ORG>5ce4c4be8c5a90d84968a55e</ORG> imports POS machines -- also known as payment or credit card machines -- from Europe and supplies them to Syndicate Bank, Bank of India, Reliance Retail and PVR Cinemas, among others.According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandate, all POS machines acquired after January 1 this year had to be enabled for Aadhaar-based biometric authentication. The date was later extended to June 30 because the rate of deployment slowed down due to a drop in the supply of such Aadhaar-enabled devices."Fingerprint authentication per se is not secure. It is about the levels and forms of encryption that companies implementing the solution follow. It is important that fingerprint data is encrypted at the source of the scanning device and remains encrypted all the way through till it reaches the card-issuing authorities," ePaisa Co-founder <PER>5ce4c38b8c5a90d84965860c</PER> told IANS.ePaisa will start manufacturing POS devices this year and plans to reach a million merchants by 2018."If somebody is able to capture the biometric data, which is easily done, they can very easily impersonate me," <PER>RAJESH SATISH MIRJANKAR</PER>, Founder, <ORG>MSWIPE TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, which supplies POS terminals to 165,000 merchants, told IANS.Apart from the increased security vulnerability to the person's biometrics, another deterrent to the digital mode would be the increased costs of the additional hardware."The costs of POS machines will go up. Currently, each terminal costs Rs 6,000. With the additional hardware, it will mean Rs 3,000-3,500 extra per terminal, which is 50 per cent increase in costs," <PER>RAJESH SATISH MIRJANKAR</PER> said."This is not technically a difficult task but rather a very expensive one. We need to attach a biometric reader to the currently available POS machines and simultaneously make changes in the application," <PER>5ce4c4be8c5a90d84968a560</PER> said.They feared that ultimately the merchants will have to bear the cost and they may pass this on to the customer.The demand for POS machines saw a steep rise just after demonetisation. At the peak of demonetisation, the government had floated a tender through <ORG>5ce4c40d8c5a90d84966cf77</ORG> to acquire one million POS machines, but so far has been unable to procure any.<ORG>MSWIPE TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> alleged that the tender was floated but the government failed to buy any POS terminals because of the cost factor.Corporation Bank said it placed an order for 10,000 devices immediately after demonetisation was announced November 8."We have approximately 30,000 POS machines.

 58fdae1d7be9e012bf285585 THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Onam-Bakrid bazar of the <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG>the Putharikandam Maidan is witnessing heavy rush, courtesy the shockingly-high prices in the open market. Just five days into the 'mega' fair, the collection has crossed Rs 21 lakh marking record sales for <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG>, officials said.'Maveli' brand items raked in Rs 6.85 lakh and while the vegetable stalls brought in over Rs 32,000 on Monday alone. "Sunday's sales stood at a collective Rs 6.38 lakh, and Saturday's at Rs 5.96 lakh," I <PER>ARSHAD HUSSAIN MIR</PER>, <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG> zonal officer said. "In fact, this year's Onam sales, so far, has risen by more than 50 per cent compared to last year," <PER>ARSHAD HUSSAIN MIR</PER> said.Inaugurated by Chief Minister <PER>5ce4c55a8c5a90d8496a3ebc</PER> on August 26, the 'mega' fair has stalls of various government agencies including <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG>, <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG> State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp), MILMA, <ORG>5ce4c3068c5a90d849643fbe</ORG> Products of India (MPI). The big attraction is the discount offered on most items.Fifteen vegetables including lady's finger, string beans, small chilly, bitter gourd, shallots, snake gourd and carrot are available at a 30 per cent discount. <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG> officials attribute the long queues to the gigantic difference in prices at <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG> outlets and the open market. <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG> offers commodities at subsidised prices ranging from 25 per cent to 60 per cent. Another reason, officials say, is the easy availability of commodities at the stalls.A similar 'Ramzan fair' organised at the same venue from June 23 to July 5 had brought in record sales for <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG>. So this time, adequate stocks have been provided anticipating a huge rush once the Onam shopping begins in earnest. At the moment, <ORG>KERALA STATE CIVIL SUPPLIES CORPN LTD</ORG> officials have provided five counters at the fair. This would be increased once the real festival rush begins after September 1, Hussain said.The fair, which is open daily from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., will be on till September 13.State can meet its needsThe state government is also vigorously promoting organic farming and Agriculture Minister VS <PER>5ce4c55a8c5a90d8496a3ebb</PER> said this year, the state will not have to depend much on vegetables from other state to cater to the increasing demand during Onam.According to <PER>5ce4c55a8c5a90d8496a3ebb</PER>, the state has produced nearly 80,000 metric tonnes of vegetables in view of Onam."We hope that the production will touch 81,000 metric tons of organic vegetables in various farms of the state.

 58fef9c17be9e0420db2a884 Dhubri, July 15: Power supply in Dhubri electrical sub-division has improved following the installation of an alternative line from Salakati, commissioning of Dhubri substation and powerline upgrade from 22MW to 35MW.The residents of Dhubri and its suburbs have heaved a sigh of relief now as the power situation has improved.Instead of unending hours of load shedding, power cuts have now been of 30-minute duration for the past week."There have been power cuts but not more than half-an-hour. In this scorching and unbearable heat, it is a huge relief," Swapan Prasad, a resident of the town, said.Operators of Xerox, Internet cafes, off-set printing and computer desktop printing are happy that they no longer have to bear generator expenses."We have to incur an expense of around Rs 1,000 to run a generator plus the monthly electricity bill. Now we are relieved of this extra expense," a Xerox operator, Monojit Paul, said.But all this improvement might not long last if the payment of monthly bill by over 21,000 consumers was irregular, said an official of the Gauripur division of <ORG>ASSAM POWER DISTRIBUTION COMPANY LIMITED</ORG>RG> here today.Earlier, Gauripur division (Dhubri is subdivision under Gauripur) received power supply to its Matiabag substation (132/33KV) from Salakati via Dhaligaon, Gossaigaon (Joyma) but now an alternative supply line has come up recently from Salakati via Adabari (Kokrajhar), Udmari (Bilasipara) to Matiabag.Talking to The Telegraph, Dhubri sub-divisional official <PER>INDU SHEKHAR MISHRA</PER> said Dhubri subdivision covers 1.5 lakh population."My priorities were to start the Dhubri substation and improve the power position. These two things and various other technical aspects have been taken care of," <PER>INDU SHEKHAR MISHRA</PER> said.However, the <ORG>ASSAM POWER DISTRIBUTION COMPANY LIMITED</ORG>ASSAM POWER DISTRIBUTION COMPANY LIMITED</ORG> is yet to receive over Rs 7.5 crore as outstanding consumer bill, including Rs 39 lakh from the government, a source said.<PER>INDU SHEKHAR MISHRA</PER> said they have started disconnecting the lines which have a huge amount of outstanding dues.

 58fd6af87be9e06c9371b9c5 NEW DELHI: The balance-sheet of major telecom operators in India -- <ORG>BHARTI AIRTEL LIMITED</ORG>, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications -- came under major pressure in the third quarter (October-December) of the current fiscal and the trend is likely to continue in the fourth quarter, say experts."Margin pressure on telcos will continue as long the free data offer from <ORG>5ce4c3678c5a90d849652685</ORG>98c5a90d849686c3f</ORG> continues.

Reliance Communications too posted a net loss of Rs 531 crore in the quarter. Vodafone India, the other big telecom operator is not listed on any Indian bourse."The quarter has seen turbulence due to the continued predatory pricing by a new operator. The present termination costs at 14 paise which are well below cost has resulted in a tsunami of minutes terminating into our network. This has led to an unprecedented year-on-year revenue decline for the industry, pressure on margins and a serious impact on the financial health of the sector," <PER>VITHAL GOPAL MAHAJAN</PER>, <ORG>BHARTI AIRTEL LIMITED</ORG>'s MD and CEO, India & South Asia, had said in a statement earlier.Idea Cellular too gave a similar reason for the sharp drop in earnings. "The Indian mobile industry witnessed an unprecedented disruption in the quarter of October to December 2016, primarily due to free voice and mobile data promotions by the new entrant in the sector," the company statement said.Reliance Communications attributed the loss to three factors. "The industry witnessed unprecedented competitive intensity. This was the first full quarter after company's complete shutdown of its profitable CDMA operations. And there was an increase in amortisation and interest expense aggregating Rs 278 crore on account of capitalisation of 850 MHz spectrum liberalisation fee," it said in a statement.Reliance Communications is owned by industrialist <PER>5ce4c50d8c5a90d849697490</PER> and <ORG>5ce4c3678c5a90d849652685</ORG>78c5a90d849652685</PER>98c5a90d849686c3f</ORG>98c5a90d849686c3f</PER>'s owner is <PER>5ce4c3678c5a90d849652685</PER>R>5ce4c4a98c5a90d849686c3f</PER> elder brother <PER>5ce4c50d8c5a90d849697494</PER>.<PER>5ce4c50d8c5a90d849697491</PER>, director, Com First, a telecom consultancy firm, also said there is no doubt that the revenue drop in the third quarter was a direct consequence of <ORG>5ce4c3678c5a90d849652685</ORG>78c5a90d849652685</PER>98c5a90d849686c3f</ORG>98c5a90d849686c3f</PER>'s aggressive free data offers."Incumbent companies, like <ORG>BHARTI AIRTEL LIMITED</ORG> and Idea, are being forced to match the prices to remain competitive.

 58fd08d17be9e06c93713871 NEW DELHI: The BJP's thumping victory in Uttar Pradesh and substantial gains made in other states will facilitate reforms as the ruling party inches closer to a majority in Upper House, <ORG>MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> said today."The 2017 state election results in India demonstrate broad-based popular support for the Indian government's policy agenda and will facilitate the implementation of further reforms, a credit positive for the sovereign," it said in a statement.While the ruling NDA has an absolute majority in Lok Sabha, it currently does not have a majority in Rajya Sabha."...the party will increase its share of seats in the Upper House (Rajya Sabha) of India's Parliament," it said. However, the changes will not be immediate, <ORG>MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> said."The ruling party will not feel the benefit of electoral gains immediately, because the changes in the upper house will only occur next year, when some members retire," says <PER>Master William Gill</PER>, <ORG>MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> Vice President and Senior Credit Officer."Nevertheless, electoral support at the state level should translate into broader support for government policy in the upper house, facilitating the passage and implementation of additional reforms," <PER>Master William Gill</PER> added.In its report, 'Government of India: State Elections Demonstrate Broad Support for Reform Agenda, a Credit Positive', <ORG>MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> said the BJP has won a net 294 seats in the five state assembly elections held over the past month."The BJP's solid gains were despite the negative economic hit from demonetisation in late 2016," it said. In 2018, 69 seats in Rajya Sabha, including 10 from UP and one from Uttarakhand, will come up for re-election."If the BJP-led coalition increases its seat tally to or close to an outright majority, passage of policies will become easier, helping to accelerate reform," it said.Also, collaboration between the central government and the new BJP-led states could improve, partially circumventing impediments to reform at the federal level on politically sensitive issues like land and labour reforms.BJP-led states like Gujarat and Rajasthan have already amended some land and labour laws.In UP, BJP secured 312 of the 403 state legislative assembly seats, up from just 47 in 2012.Unlike rival parties in UP, the BJP did not nominate a local chief ministerial candidate but focused on the leadership of <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645cd4</PER> himself."The BJP's success reflects strong popular support for Prime Minister <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645cd4</PER> and <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645cd4</PER> national policy agenda.By contrast, the 2012 UP election outcome reflected popular support for individuals in the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party," <ORG>MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> said.In addition to UP, the BJP also took majority of the seats in Uttarakhand.In Goa, Manipur and Punjab, the opposition Congress party won the largest number of seats, although the BJP did increase its share in Manipur.Currently, the NDA government, led by the BJP, hold about 30 per cent of the total seats in Rajya Sabha."Therefore, the ruling party will continue to rely on alliances with representatives of other parties to push through policy measures," it said.

ANUPAM GOYAL 	 INDIA TRANSACT SERVICES LIMITED 
 58fd36107be9e06c93717259 NEW DELHI: The demand for point of sale (POS) devices -- which saw a spurt after demonetisation as people and merchants opted for cashless transactions -- could be dented by the mandate to make them Aadhaar-enabled as this will push up costs and increase security risks, industry players said."One of the biggest challenges in making the POS machines Aadhaar-enabled is the high cost of adoption as well verifying its reliability. Tampering and skimming threats for merchants and processors of card data are on the rise," <PER>ANUPAM GOYAL</PER>, Chairman and Managing Director, <ORG>INDIA TRANSACT SERVICES LIMITED</ORG>68a55e</ORG>, told IANS.<ORG>INDIA TRANSACT SERVICES LIMITED</ORG> imports POS machines -- also known as payment or credit card machines -- from Europe and supplies them to Syndicate Bank, Bank of India, Reliance Retail and PVR Cinemas, among others.According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandate, all POS machines acquired after January 1 this year had to be enabled for Aadhaar-based biometric authentication. The date was later extended to June 30 because the rate of deployment slowed down due to a drop in the supply of such Aadhaar-enabled devices."Fingerprint authentication per se is not secure. It is about the levels and forms of encryption that companies implementing the solution follow. It is important that fingerprint data is encrypted at the source of the scanning device and remains encrypted all the way through till it reaches the card-issuing authorities," ePaisa Co-founder <PER>5ce4c38b8c5a90d84965860c</PER> told IANS.ePaisa will start manufacturing POS devices this year and plans to reach a million merchants by 2018."If somebody is able to capture the biometric data, which is easily done, they can very easily impersonate me," <PER>5ce4c4be8c5a90d84968a55c</PER>, Founder, <ORG>5ce4c4be8c5a90d84968a55f</ORG>, which supplies POS terminals to 165,000 merchants, told IANS.Apart from the increased security vulnerability to the person's biometrics, another deterrent to the digital mode would be the increased costs of the additional hardware."The costs of POS machines will go up. Currently, each terminal costs Rs 6,000. With the additional hardware, it will mean Rs 3,000-3,500 extra per terminal, which is 50 per cent increase in costs," <PER>5ce4c4be8c5a90d84968a55c</PER> said."This is not technically a difficult task but rather a very expensive one. We need to attach a biometric reader to the currently available POS machines and simultaneously make changes in the application," <PER>ANUPAM GOYAL</PER> said.They feared that ultimately the merchants will have to bear the cost and they may pass this on to the customer.The demand for POS machines saw a steep rise just after demonetisation. At the peak of demonetisation, the government had floated a tender through <ORG>5ce4c40d8c5a90d84966cf77</ORG> to acquire one million POS machines, but so far has been unable to procure any.<ORG>5ce4c4be8c5a90d84968a55f</ORG> alleged that the tender was floated but the government failed to buy any POS terminals because of the cost factor.Corporation Bank said it placed an order for 10,000 devices immediately after demonetisation was announced November 8."We have approximately 30,000 POS machines. An order for about 10,000 additional POS machines was placed after demonetisation for immediate use," Eknath Baliga, Manger, KYC-Antimoney Laundering Cell, Corporation Bank, <PER>5ce4c4be8c5a90d84968a55d</PER>, told IANS."Our sales shot up by 300 per cent in November and December compared with the previous year," <ORG>INDIA TRANSACT SERVICES LIMITED</ORG>68a55e</ORG> said.The total value of financial transactions done by the debit and credit cards issued by at POS terminals was at Rs 51,883.68 crore while the number of transactions stood at approximately 23 lakh in October 2016.About 15 lakh POS terminals were deployed by the banks in October.But as cash returns to the system again, the demand for POS machines is tapering and these additional directives can prove a further deterrent to POS machines, the industry said, adding that there was no clarity on the revenue model in the Aadhaar-enabled payment system (AEPS)."There is no revenue model defined for AEPS payments against the card-based payment system where MDR (Merchant Discount Rate) is a source of revenue.

RAGHVENDRA NATH 	 LADDERUP WEALTH MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED 
 58fcf0eea3d24b32cb27642f The sovereign gold bond scheme launched by the government last month is expected to give mutual funds a run for their money as investors could choose it over the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of domestic fund houses.The bond scheme is part of three gold-related schemes launched by the government and has witnessed significant response from the investor community. According to the government, 63,000 applications were received for a total of Rs 246.2 crore representing 917 kg of gold.While the first tranche of gold bonds closed for subscription on November 20, the government has said that more tranches would be issued during the financial year 2015-16.The intention of the government is to reduce the demand for physical gold.Financial planners say that the gold bond scheme is a better option for investors looking to invest in gold but, at the same time, are comfortable without getting physical gold.The gold bond scheme is for the evolved investor who is bullish on gold and is fine with not getting physical gold."The scheme gets you the price of gold on redemption plus an additional interest. In fact, all gold schemes launched by the government are way ahead of ETFs, says <PER>RAGHVENDRA NATH</PER>, managing director, <ORG>LADDERUP WEALTH MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, a Mumbai-based financial advisory firm.The sovereign gold bond scheme is a paperless form of investing in gold. The tenor of the bonds is eight years and there is an option to exit from the fifth year onwards. Investors also get an annual interest of 2.75 per cent on the bonds, which can also be used as collateral for availing a loan facility.On the other hand, gold ETFs are schemes launched by mutual fund houses wherein investors can buy units representing gold value in a dematerialised form.Most of the leading fund houses like Axis MF, Birla Sun Life MF, HDFC MF, ICICI Prudential, Kotak MF, Reliance MF and SBI MF all have gold ETFs among the schemes they have placed on offer.Returns vs flexibilityThe chief executive officer of a leading domestic bank-sponsored mutual fund house says government schemes are better in terms of returns but ETFs offer more flexibility in terms of liquidity.<PER>RAGHVENDRA NATH</PER> adds, We have gold ETFs and the flows in the schemes are used to buy gold. We manage the fund and charge an expense for that."The repayment is done with an equivalent amount of gold. The gold bond scheme gives an interest and the repayment is in gold."So, effectively the returns would be higher in the gold bond scheme as mutual funds would be priced out. However, gold ETFs give you more liquidity while the gold bond scheme has a lock-in period.Gold ETFs are listed and traded on the stock exchange platform and so the units can be easily sold or bought, which is not the case with the sovereign gold bonds.According to industry body Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), the total assets under management (AUM) of gold ETFs was Rs 5,830 crore as on November 30. There are approximately 12-13 gold ETFs that are currently being offered by various mutual fund houses.Gold bonds are better for investors who want to invest in gold but are comfortable without physical gold

 593ac4447be9e001d89d5f3a It can be a coffee mug with a personalised message, a T-shirt or even a household essential. The concept and variety of corporate souvenirs has changed here as in other parts of the country over the recent years. Products and services under this category have expanded, turned innovative and become a way of expressing the company's ideals and aims.Caps, key chains, mugs, pens, calendars, diaries, and silverware are some of the common items that are presented as souvenirs and corporate gifts. According to <PER>5ce4cb438c5a90d84979f702</PER>, general manager (Marketing) of Aquasub Pumps, companies generally try to accommodate the firm's name and logo in the souvenir.Some souvenirs are chosen so that they benefit the receiver. For instance, a tool kit given to a mechanic will help <PER>5ce4cb438c5a90d84979f702</PER> in <PER>5ce4cb438c5a90d84979f702</PER> profession. On annual days, some companies give gifts to the family of the employees, too. Thus, it is not just brand promotion. Business gifts for customers depend on the product manufactured by the company and the market that it is intended for. When the souvenirs given to employees, visitors, suppliers or distributors are personalised, the receiver cherishes it, <PER>5ce4cb438c5a90d84979f702</PER> says.<PER>MANISH KUMAR TIBREWAL</PER>, managing director of <ORG>JAGANNATH TEXTILE COMPANY LIMITED</ORG>, says the company's calendar with the picture and message of Swami Vivekananda is to spread the values of Swami Vivekananda among the youth and the company also abides by these. About a lakh calendars are distributed every year to educational institutions and hospitals.The company also sends out greetings to teachers on Teachers' Day and plans to do so for doctors on Doctors' Day. They contribute and we recognise. This is also a way of keeping in touch with the society, <PER>MANISH KUMAR TIBREWAL</PER> says. Similarly, when there are visitors to the factory, they value the souvenir given even if its cost may not be high.<PER>5ce4cb438c5a90d84979f704</PER>, managing director of <ORG>5ce4cb438c5a90d84979f703</ORG>, says the company organises annual days regularly for suppliers. For the distributors, some of the top performers are even taken abroad.An industrial source says that apart from gifts, companies have also started recognising the services of their supporters and stake holders with tours, etc.However, with every business seeing a decline in profitability, recognition through souvenirs is gradually coming down and personal meetings through annual days and get together events are gaining popular.

"Consumption of tea is lower in Kenya, which helps the country to export most of the crop. Kenya began to focus on production when consumption in India increased and exports started declining. It was then that the owners of the gardens in Kenya captured the exports market," said <PER>5ce4c6558c5a90d8496cc33d</PER>, general manager of <ORG>5ce4c6558c5a90d8496cc33e</ORG>. "A number of tea companies having factories and packaging units in Kenya import tea from other producing nations, including India and Sri Lanka, to blend them with the Kenyan variety after which it is exported. This is possible as there is no import duty on tea in Kenya," <PER>MANJUSHREE MAHESHWARY</PER> said. "Tea from almost all east-African nations such as Uganda and Burundi are sold at the Mombasa tea auction centre in Kenya and then exported, pushing up the export figures over yields," <PER>MANJUSHREE MAHESHWARY</PER> told The Telegraph. Kenya's export to Russia during January-June stood at 10.2 million kg, while 27.4 million kg was shipped to the UK . India exported 22.16 million kg to Russia and 5.39 million kg to the UK during the period. However, its export to Pakistan stood at 6.08 million kg, while the African counterpart exported 72.9 million kg. July forecast Tea exporters of India are expecting a 10 per cent fall in shipments in July. "The country's production is lower this year and that will bring down exports by about 10 per cent in July. In fact, export contracts are lower by Rs 10-15 a kg over last year," said <PER>5ce4c60e8c5a90d8496c1677</PER>, director of Asian Tea and Exports Ltd. Experts said the bulk of the tea exported till June was last year's produce. This year's yields will be exported from July. "Erratic weather conditions will lower production. In certain districts of Assam, the crop will be reduced by around 20 per cent in July," said <PER>5ce4c68b8c5a90d8496d5b07</PER>, secretary-general of the Tea Association of India. "Tea prices are lower in July and August on lower exports over last year and a boom in Kenya's production," <PER>5ce4c5dc8c5a90d8496b9cbc</PER>, chief financial officer of McLeod Russel, said.

 58ff2ba97be9e0420db2df4e Nobel Museum Tea blend. Picture courtesy: Nobel Museum Guwahati, Dec. 12: An orange pekoe tea variety from a garden in Upper Assam's Sivasagar district was blended with a Chinese tea for the special guests at the Nobel Prize ceremony on Wednesday. "One of the components for the Nobel Museum Tea blend is a lovely rich Assam orange pekoe (OP) 1 from the estate of Mangalam in Sonari. Assam contributes to a traditional rich bouquet that does not fade when flavoured with the bergamot from Southern Sicily and the Swedish raspberries. It leaves a slight malty aroma after the first sip," said <PER>5ce4c6f28c5a90d8496e69da</PER>, managing director of The Tea Centre of Stockholm, said in an email to The Telegraph today. The Nobel Museum Tea blend was prepared by The Tea Centre of Stockholm, a small Sweden-based company, in collaboration with Nobel Museum. The tea blend was created for the first time in honour of <PER>5ce4c6f28c5a90d8496e69db</PER> celebrating <PER>5ce4c6f28c5a90d8496e69da</PER> work and what it stands for. The Chinese Keemun tea is produced in Qimen county in Anhui province. Orange pekoe is characterised by whole leaf. "While composing a blend, one must imagine the base tea. This base tea blend should be able to withstand future fluctuations in taste, aroma and also quality and price. So we, as blenders, hardly ever use only one origin in our base. Instead, we try to capture the unique and delicate bouquets of different origins and bring them together to create a blend like no other," <PER>5ce4c6f28c5a90d8496e69da</PER> added. Mangalam tea estate, a 150-hectare garden, lies 52km from National Highway 37. It produces very high quality Assam Orthodox and CTC teas, fetching premium prices due its quality and demand. Its Orthodox tea is totally absorbed by the German market and the CTC teas are also in good demand. The company has 10 gardens in Assam. "This is a very good news for us; it proves that our teas are of high quality. We pluck fine and produce some of the best golden tippy teas," said <PER>Suruchi Maheshwari</PER>, managing director of <ORG>JAY SHREE TEA AND INDUSTRIES LIMITED</ORG> and Industries Limited. Last year, the broken pekoe clonal grade of tea of CTC variety produced at Mangalam tea garden in Sivasagar district, belonging to Jayashree Tea and Industries, fetched a price of Rs 401 and Rs 405 per kg at Calcutta Tea Auction Centre.

"This has been my first indulgence in quality Assam CTC tea and it has been a worthy one," <PER>BALKISHAN SARIA</PER>, managing director of the <ORG>DARJEELING POWER LIMITED</ORG> company, told The Telegraph. "This was just an experiment. We hope to contribute to Assam tea and will keep on buying good quality tea from there regularly," <PER>BALKISHAN SARIA</PER> said. The record prices fetched by Halmari tea recently had forced <PER>BALKISHAN SARIA</PER> to take a look at Assam CTC, <PER>BALKISHAN SARIA</PER> added. The company had bid for it the last time and had come quite close. There was stiff bidding at the auctions for the CTC tea, which had bright liquor and great aroma, before it was purchased by Golden Tips. The 125.8kg CTC tea was auctioned by <ORG>5ce4c3d48c5a90d849663ba7</ORG> Private Ltd - the largest tea auctioneers in the world.

The company plans to make this premium, rare and limited-edition tea available to nearly 1,250 customers and connoisseurs in the country and overseas, in 100g packets on a first-come-first served basis.

SUBASHINI JAYAKUMAR 	 MAHENDRA PUMPS PRIVATE LIMITED 
 593ccd2d7be9e00dabcb9504 What started about a decade ago in small numbers is now an industrial trend here and is all set to grow higher. Employment of women is increasing across sectors here. Women make up nearly 80 per cent of the total workforce in the textile mills in Coimbatore region and they are into all core activities in the units.In the foundries, general engineering, and pumpset units, they are 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the total employees. In the foundries here, women are employed mainly in core-making and house keeping sections.In the pumpset units, they wind coils and paint. In the workshops, they operate CNC, drilling and milling machinery.Women employment in manufacturing units and on-shop floors here has gone up during the last five years. It is a matter of time for women to get into assembling and core manufacturing in the engineering units, says <PER>SUBASHINI JAYAKUMAR</PER>, managing director of <ORG>MAHENDRA PUMPS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>.They are committed, have an eye for detail, work longer hours as they do not take short breaks, and excel in a trade when they are trained in it. Hence, industries prefer to recruit women. Labour shortage in the factories and more women coming out to explore work opportunities are the two main reasons for the trend, <PER>SUBASHINI JAYAKUMAR</PER> says.Most of those employed in the foundries and engineering units are from this region.Even small-scale units have created basic facilities on their premises for women workers.They are mostly recruited for unskilled jobs, trained and slowly get into specific sections. Their wages are almost the same as men.With increasing demand for workers and automation in industries, the scope for women employment is high.Women industrial training institutes should be set up so that interested candidates can take up diploma programmes in mechanical and electrical engineering.Women should be encouraged to take up organised courses to develop their skills, <PER>SUBASHINI JAYAKUMAR</PER> says.Five years ago, some of the leading textile mills used to have recruitment just once a month.Now, they do it almost every day and yet face labour shortage. Hence, many units are going in for casual workers. But, the number of women in this category is less, according to a Southern India Mills' Association official.

 58fcc7ea7be9e05815ecde17 The 12{+t}{+h}edition of the ongoing Osians Cinefan Film Festival (OCFF) here is paying tribute to distinguished director <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER> who passed away in July last year. As part of the tribute, films such as Duvidha , Siddheshwari , Ahmak and Nazar among others are being screened. The selection is a partial but representative retrospective of Kauls oeuvre, spanning documentaries and feature films based on original screenplays as well as <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER> interpretations of <PER>5ce4c3f88c5a90d849669963</PER> novels. Additionally, Alms for the Blind Horse , directed by Gurvinder Singh and made in Mani Kauls style, is also being screened as part of the tribute.Speaking to The Hindu , <PER>5ce4c3f88c5a90d849669965</PER>, the curator of the tribute and a friend of the late director, explained what <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER> stood for. <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER> was a cinema of feeling, and the feeling was conveyed through music. <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER> approached films temporally and not visually.Describing <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER> technique as cutting in time, <PER>5ce4c3f88c5a90d849669965</PER> aligned Kauls approach to the methods employed by film-makers such as Robert Bresson and Andre Tarkovsky, who treated cinematography in an elevated sense and not as the work of a cameraperson.But the similarities only go so far. While Bresson believed in re-takes, <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER> believed in chance and accidents, often using not-good (NG) shots as well. Everything was sacred for <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER>.As the Creative Director of the film festival, <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER> was very much involved with the shaping of OCFFs journey. According to <PER>NEVILLE TULI</PER>, Founder Chairman at Osians Connoisseurs of <ORG>AEP INDUSTRIES PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, however, <PER>NEVILLE TULI</PER> having been a member of the Osians family is purely incidental and it is the recognition of <PER>NEVILLE TULI</PER> multifarious talent that has led to the showing of a large number of <PER>NEVILLE TULI</PER> filmsThe films that have been screened so far have been prefaced by introductions from collaborators of <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER>, such as Navroze Contractor, cinematographer, and <PER>5ce4c3f88c5a90d849669962</PER>, actor, who share their memories of working with <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER>. In addition to the retrospective, several panel discussions have been organised and an annual Mani Kaul Memorial Lecture instituted to commemorate the director. Although the lecture, which was to be delivered on Monday by <PER>5ce4c3f88c5a90d849669964</PER>, Director of the Rome International Film Festival, had to be cancelled due to clashes in scheduling, a panel discussion titled Water, Clay, Metal and Sound, which shed light on the aesthetic processes of Mani Kauls cinema, took place as planned. The discussants included sound recordists, camerapersons and production persons who collaborated with <PER>5ce4c3cd8c5a90d8496626cb</PER>.

PRABHU MUTHANNA GUMMATIRA 	 WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY - INDIA 
 58fdff9f7be9e012c79df0df The Forest Department is keen to shift a few temples located inside the Bandipur Tiger Reserve to the forest periphery, in a bid to minimise human disturbance in the wildlife habitat.This is consequent to the growing popularity of some of the temples inside the tiger reserve among people living on the fringes of the forests who frequent the temples during specific festivals. The heavy pilgrim footfall inside the national park and tiger reserve tends to aggravate the man-animal conflict, but there is also the threat of poachers gaining access to wildlife areas during such gatherings to consider.Conservator of Forests and Director of Bandipur Tiger <PER>5ce4c5778c5a90d8496a93ad</PER> told The Hindu that the plan to shift a few temples to the periphery was in its preliminary stages.There is a provision under the Forest Act to allot land up to a maximum of one acre on the periphery of the forests for relocation. We will make an offer to the village committee to shift the temples in lieu of land to be allocated on the forest boundaries, said <PER>5ce4c4788c5a90d84967f161</PER>.There are six temples inside Bandipur, and authorities plan to shift four of them. The remaining two  at Himmavad Gopalaswamy in Bandipur and Belladakuppe in the Hediyala range  are big temples and cannot be relocated. As a solution, the local community would be asked to tone down the festivities.Although the Belladakuppe Mahadeshwara temple committee members have been convinced of the need to scale down festivities, it may not happen overnight and hence a constant effort and awareness drive is required, said <PER>5ce4c5778c5a90d8496a93ad</PER>. The issue is complex because the temple is patronised not by just one village but dozens of villages in the periphery and hence the consent of all villages should be secured.But at Himmavad Gopalaswamy temple, the department is keen to bring in a new system in place under which the movement of all private vehicles to the hilltop will be banned. We will have a parking lot near Hangala or at the base of the hill. Forest Department vehicles will transport pilgrims to the temple and bring them back, thus regulating the crowd, <PER>5ce4c5778c5a90d8496a93ad</PER> added.Unlike other temples inside Bandipur, where pilgrims come only on a particular day of a season, the Belladakuppe Mahadeshwara temple attracts people every Monday. There was also a dargah in the Gundre range and another temple at Dodda Bargi in Maddur range, both of which draw significant crowd and pose a threat to wildlife. The scenario in the adjoining Nagarahole National Park is no different; it harbours over 40 places of worship, according to P.M. <PER>PRABHU MUTHANNA GUMMATIRA</PER>, Assistant Director, <ORG>WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY - INDIA</ORG>, India Programme, who added that efforts to relocate places of worship should also be undertaken at Nagarahole.

As far as illegal allotment of land is concerned, the judge observed that allotment was made by State High-Level Clearance Committee.The prima facie charge of conspiracy would fail as proceedings against <PER>5ce4c3748c5a90d84965481f</PER>, Managing Director of ITASCA company, who was accused No.3 in the case, was already quashed by the high court in March 2016.

The judge expressed surprise as to why corporate bodies of ITASCA and <ORG>UTL TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED</ORG> were not named in the chargesheet.The Special Lokayukta Court had rejected Naidus discharge application on April 29, 2013. <PER>BASAVAPURNAIAH CHALASANI</PER> then moved the High Court challenging the said order.The court also quashed the proceedings against M Gopi, former Corporator of BBMP and accused No.9, in connection with the ITASCA case and discharged from it.In another case, <PER>5ce4c3328c5a90d84964a619</PER> quashed the criminal proceedings pending against Dasarahalli MLA S Muniraju, who was accused of grabbing private land.K Ranganathaiah, then special tahasildar, Bengaluru North, registered a case in connection with the disputed land at Kereguddadahalli in Chikkabanavara, Bengaluru.Lastly, Justice Reddy also allowed the criminal petition filed by Yelahanka MLA S R Vishwanath who challenged the private complaint regarding disproportionate assets registered by Akhila Karnataka Police Mahasabha president <PER>5ce4c5228c5a90d84969b180</PER> and others.In <PER>5ce4c3328c5a90d84964a619</PER> petition, Vishwanath contended that sanction to prosecute <PER>5ce4c3328c5a90d84964a619</PER> was rejected by the Speaker when the petitioner was an MLA earlier. Lokayukta court did not act on case for six months thereafter and took cognisance in June 2013 after <PER>5ce4c3328c5a90d84964a619</PER> earlier term as MLA ended. <PER>5ce4c3328c5a90d84964a619</PER> became an MLA again in 2013.

 593d15107be9e00dabcbca76 The Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has promised to prevail upon the Railway Ministry to accord permission to Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.

Though it was planned before the Delhi Metro (in April 1994), nothing was on the drawing board till about 2006. The delay was mainly because of technicalities involved in the formation of a special purpose vehicle to execute the project.<PER>5ce4c39d8c5a90d84965b710</PER> claimed BMRCL took four and a half years to open its first reach for commercial operations while Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had taken five and a half years to open the first reach. Still people talk about delay in execution of Namma Metro and everything depends upon one's perception. Unlike in the West where the projects are executed sequentially, BMRCL is executing the project parallelly to speed up the work, <PER>5ce4c39d8c5a90d84965b710</PER> said.<PER>5ce4c39d8c5a90d84965b710</PER> said the works of burrowing tunnels beneath railway lines at the City Railway Station, construction of the underground metro station, the down-ramp for the North-South corridor near Swastik, viaduct cross-over on the railway track near Sriramapura and the pedestrian overbridge at Byappanahalli were delayed. Sources in the South Western Railway told The Hindu that the Railway Board was examining the proposals of BMRCL and the clearances may come any time.

 592381e87be9e01fcef035d1 How Mars Mission project director won his battle against cancerBengaluru, Feb 4, 2015, DHNS: 0:48 ISTA lesser-known fact about <PER>5ce4c3bd8c5a90d849660267</PER>, the project director of the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) and a Padmashri awardee, is that <PER>5ce4c3bd8c5a90d849660267</PER> is a cancer survivor.Even as the MOM was preparing for take-off in September 2014, <PER>5ce4c3bd8c5a90d849660267</PER> was undergoing treatment for colon cancer at Manipal Hospitals here. The treatment had been going on for a year and a half.To me cancer was in a way a boon as it brought out the best in me. I had the time to think and prepare for the MOM. When you are fighting cancer, more than the medical care, it is the will power, confidence and determination which help you fight the disease, <PER>5ce4c3bd8c5a90d849660267</PER> told Deccan Herald on the sidelines of the launch of Not Beyond Us, a cancer campaign organised by <ORG>MANIPAL HEALTH SYSTEMS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> Hospitals as part of World Cancer Day on Wednesday.My motivation and drive were MOM. My ailment gave me the confidence to handle the project and face worse situations.<PER>5ce4c3bd8c5a90d849660267</PER> continued, When I started suffering from the pain, I underwent tests and was diagnosed with colon cancer, which was in an early stage. I immediately started treatment. Early detection is one of the prime ways to fight cancer. Although the actual cause of cancer is not known, lifestyle plays an important role. Now, I am fortunate to be associated with the mission of spreading the message of fighting cancer as the Brand Ambassador of <ORG>MANIPAL HEALTH SYSTEMS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> Hospitals for colon cancer.Colon cancer, also called colorectal cancer, occurs in the large intestine when there is uncontrolled cell growth. This is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women the world over. Dr H <PER>SUDARSHAN LAL BALUJA</PER>, Medical Director and Chairman of Medical Advisory Board, <ORG>MANIPAL HEALTH SYSTEMS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, said that according to a recent report in a UK journal and the experience of Indian doctors, in 60 per cent of the cases cancer occurs because of genetic mutation.In the other 40 per cent, it is due to lifestyle changes, obesity, smoking, use of tobacco and environmental toxins. Although usually men are more prone to cancer, women are increasingly developing the disease because of smoking and lifestyle changes. The most common cancers we encounter in adults (aged above 50) are breast, prostate, colon and cervical cancer.

NIKHIL MANOHAR NAIK 	 AMAZON INDIA LIMITED 
 593dfdc67be9e00dabcc7506 Like most Indians, <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645f46</PER> prefers to pay cash-on-delivery for online purchases. But its not because <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645f46</PER> is worried about security issues while doing banking transactions on the Internet. <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645f46</PER> reasons are different.<PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645f46</PER>, a 37-year-old government servant, lives in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a region with poor and erratic Internet connectivity. This means ordering something online requires meticulous planning and a good amount of luck as the process can be interrupted anytime.Poor connectivityPaying online would mean another additional step  the risk of being cut-off from the worldwide Web before the order is placed.When you choose the cash-on-delivery option, the order is placed faster, says <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645f46</PER>, who depends on these online purchases to buy certain groceries that are not available in the remote islands. Mr. Kumars online shopping woes illustrate the infrastructure issues prevalent in the Andamans.But while <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645f46</PER> ordeal may end with the order being placed, for others like <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fb</PER> and <PER>5ce4c3468c5a90d84964d49c</PER> the challenges begin after that. <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fb</PER> and <PER>5ce4c3468c5a90d84964d49c</PER> have, through their firm Apt Logistics, helped e-commerce giant Amazon enter these islands, where the brick-and-mortar shopping choices are limited.From 12 packages per day in July 2015, today Amazon dispatches 500-700 packages to <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fc</PER> (the capital of the islands) and Havelock Island. All consignments to this little city come from Chennai. From here, the consignments for Havelock Island, among the largest islands in the region, are transported through a ferry.Shopping onlineIn 2015, I went around the Andamans and did a preliminary study on how comfortable people here would be shopping online, says <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fb</PER>, 33, a research scholar from Mumbai who has now shifted base to <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fc</PER>. The outcome was positive.In July 2015, we joined the Amazon family and from there the journey has been exciting because this is a different market when compared with other cities in India, <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fb</PER> said.The consignments arrive from Chennai through the air. From the Port Blair airport, the consignments are taken in a van to a 1,500 sq ft delivery centre. A 15-member team unloads the consignment, verifies and scans the packages and then sorts them according to the pincodes. From here, the packages are taken in bikes and small vans.At Havelock, Apt Logistics has partnered with local players to manage deliveries. Of the total consignments that land at <MISC>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fc</MISC>, 3-5% is sent to Havelock. Once the ferry arrives at Havelock, the local team picks up the consignments and delivers them through two-wheelers and vans.Chips, masala packetsEven the orders are interesting. Consumers buy a lot of chips, masala packets, and eatables as well as ladders, brooms, and mayonnaise. <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fb</PER> says one of <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fb</PER> early deliveries was a dog bone. The customer wanted to check how an e-commerce portal works and he placed an order for a dog bone (Rs. 2). He opened the pack and gave the bone to a stray dog and later became our regular customer.<PER>5ce4c3468c5a90d84964d49c</PER>, <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fb</PER> business partner, points out that things would be a lot easier if Internet connectivity improved. Net connectivity is very slow here and in some parts of the island there is no Internet at all, <PER>5ce4c3468c5a90d84964d49c</PER> says. Once that happens, our sales will increase 10-fold.The worlds largest online retailer also has plans to expand in this market. There are plans to expand into untouched geographies. North and Middle Andamans is the target for the year. We are in discussions with local courier teams in these places, says <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fb</PER>.<PER>NIKHIL MANOHAR NAIK</PER>, VP  India Customer Fulfilment, <ORG>AMAZON INDIA LIMITED</ORG>, says Amazon currently delivers in two islands and the numbers could go up with better Internet connectivity. Sales in the region have gone up 15 times in just two years, <PER>NIKHIL MANOHAR NAIK</PER> said.We were well aware of some of the constraints here which were relatively stronger than other remote areas  be it poor Internet connectivity, extreme weather conditions, offloads and the limited last mile delivery footprint. We collaboratively worked with our service partner Apt Logistics to manage and overcome each of these challenges.Flight connectivity from Chennai into <PER>5ce4cd338c5a90d8497f58fc</PER> is another major factor impacting deliveries. During the Chennai floods (2014), the airport in the city was closed for a few days which impacted our deliveries into the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. However, during cyclone Vardah, the airport was closed in Chennai for just a day, and hence we had no impact, <PER>NIKHIL MANOHAR NAIK</PER> said.Being able to buy online was a great relief, says Amazons customer A.H. Harish. Earlier, if there is anything new in the market, I had to ask my friends in Chennai or Mumbai to courier it to me. But with Amazon, my shopping has become easier.

SRIDHAR 	 TAKE SOLUTIONS LIMITED 
 593a9ec67be9e07f4fdd5568 Will special economic zones (SEZs) be an attractive proposition for the information technology companies to set up their units, going forward? With the exemption for STPI (Software Technology Parks of India) coming to an end by March 2011, many IT companies were looking at SEZ as an alternative. But with the levy of MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax) on the developers of SEZs as well as on the units operating in SEZs, the SEZs lose a bit of shine in wooing the potential investors.According to Sec. 10 AA of the Income-tax Act, SEZs are given 100 per cent tax exemption for the first five years, 50 per cent for the next five years and 50 per cent of the plough back of the export profit for the next five years. It may be recalled that last year a Bill was introduced in Parliament for implementing Direct Taxes Code (DTC) by 2012 and as per the provision in DTC, SEZ developers and units would be subject to pay a MAT of 20 per cent on the book profits. The DTC Bill was referred to the parliamentary finance committee. In the meanwhile, SEZ developers' bodies, such as TASID (Tamil Nadu Association of SEZ Infrastructure Developers) and EPCS (<ORG>5ce4c4808c5a90d8496800db</ORG> and SEZs) approached the parliamentary committee and demanded that SEZ Act should be a standalone Act and it should not be disturbed by the DTC code.The Union Government in the current budget had proposed to increase the rate of MAT for companies from the current rate of 18 per cent to 18.5 per cent of book profits to keep the effective rate of MAT at the same level. As a measure to ensure equal sharing of the corporate tax liability, the Union Finance Minister has proposed to levy MAT on developers of SEZs as well as units operating in SEZs. This proposal, according N. <PER>5ce4cae68c5a90d8497903bc</PER>, Vice-President, TASID, and Central Governing Council Member of EPCS, has defeated the very purpose of the SEZ developers' body's request.<PER>5ce4cae68c5a90d8497903bc</PER> said the Union Government had negated its own SEZ Act. The Act says that it would exempt all taxes and levies for those companies which set up units in SEZs. <PER>5ce4cae68c5a90d8497903bc</PER> feels that many companies have invested heavily in SEZs. Now imposing 18.5 per cent MAT on the companies in SEZs has caused heavy heart burns for many. Already, the corporate tax for the companies was 30 per cent and by introducing 18.5 per cent MAT, the companies were bound to get a tax benefit of 12 per cent only.On the extension of STPI benefits, K. Thirugnanam, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ascenders Technologies, said in the 2010-11 budget, small and medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) expected the Centre to extend the tax benefits for two years, but unfortunately it was done only for a year and in the current budget, there has been no mention of extending the STPI scheme. This has disappointed the IT-SME sector.The IT companies are recovering back from the economic slowdown in 2008-09. The larger companies have bounced back in 2010, and the SME sector is still in the recovery phase, as they are forced to compete with the emerging IT-SME community in other countries. Indian IT-SMEs need unconditional support from the Union Government, which should extend tax benefits for at least a year.A negative factor that can affect IT-SMEs is the one-year gap between the DTC implementation and the non-extension of the STPI benefits.S. <PER>SRIDHAR</PER>, Managing Director, <ORG>TAKE SOLUTIONS LIMITED</ORG>, feels that the 18.5 per cent MAT will have a huge impact on the IT companies.

 5903e0367be9e026559b185a Calcutta: The consortium that have bagged the rights to own the Calcutta franchise of the Indian Super League are proud and excited to be able to bring the city on the map of the IMG-Reliance Star India venture. <PER>5ce4c8888c5a90d84972ac5d</PER>, <PER>HARSHAVARDHAN THAMINAAR</PER>, <PER>5ce4c8888c5a90d84972ac5e</PER> and <PER>5ce4c6188c5a90d8496c2bb4</PER> are looking ahead to the support and blessings of the state government to make it a success. We want to win the League this year itself, said <PER>HARSHAVARDHAN THAMINAAR</PER>, chairman of the Ambuja Realty Group. We will of course discuss our plans with the state government. We will need the support of the state as they will have a say in the infrastructure development and the venues. <PER>5ce4c8888c5a90d84972ac5d</PER> iterated that the support from the state would be necessary. We have to know which of the grounds will be available. We will need support from the state. We hope to be able to use the Salt Lake Stadium as a venue, though nothing has been finalised as yet. We just got the team on Sunday. It is way too early to say anything. Give us time, only then things will fall into place. The name of the team and team colours are yet to be decided. And the co-owners still dont have any idea about the players who will be available for them. With Atletico de Madrid as part of the consortium, the Calcutta team will obviously have an edge. They are the best team in Europe. Indian football will benefit from the fact that they have shown interest. However, we still have to find a balance between the worth of a player and how much we can spend on <PER>5ce4c8888c5a90d84972ac5d</PER>. We can only have one marquee player and about 8-10 foreign players in the squad. We will also try to bring in local talents as end of the day, people will come to watch the game. If the standard of football is not good then there will be no interest, <PER>5ce4c8888c5a90d84972ac5d</PER> said. Asked about their plans of infrastructure development  which was one of the criteria for the bid  <PER>HARSHAVARDHAN THAMINAAR</PER> said: IMG-Reliance, organisers of the league, will give us the guidelines and we will have to implement it here. But it is too early to say anything definite. <PER>5ce4c8888c5a90d84972ac5d</PER> added: Infrastructure, of course is important. At the end of the day, you need a good ground, a net, a ball and a set of good players who are willing to play. Thats what creates good footballers. It is true for all sport. When Sachin (Tendulkar) or I started playing, we used to play on matting wickets. The infrastructure in cricket you see today was not available. But we were among the best. When Pele or Maradona started to play, they didnt have fancy infrastructure. So first, we need to get quality players and then we can plan everything. We hope to nurture the game. <PER>5ce4c8888c5a90d84972ac5d</PER>, however, warned that people should not compare the ISL with the success of IPL right now. Dont compare it with IPL ... Im being honest. But as we say, its the start of something... Hopefully, somewhere down the line, things will improve. We pray that all the money that we put in gets recovered. But its not going to be easy. But <PER>HARSHAVARDHAN THAMINAAR</PER>, <ORG>GOENKA DIAMONDS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> and <PER>5ce4c6188c5a90d8496c2bb4</PER> maintained that this was less of a business venture for them and more of an emotional commitment. Its a proud moment. An emotional moment for us, said <ORG>GOENKA DIAMONDS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group supremo. We were born and brought up in this city. We owe everything to Calcutta. Its time to pay back. We need to give the citizens something to be proud of. Representatives of Atletico de Madrid will be in the city in the next few weeks to thrash out details. While the website of the iconic club has already put up a name for the team, <PER>5ce4c8888c5a90d84972ac5d</PER> said: Nothing has been finalised, but we are happy that they are showing so much interest.

The unprecedented popular support for <PER>5ce4c32e8c5a90d849649c8b</PER> strikes a chord with this section because they can identify with what the aam aadmi' is going through, <PER>5ce4c6b48c5a90d8496dc446</PER> remarked.Small and bigMr. <PER>5ce4c6b48c5a90d8496dc446</PER> observes that corruption means different things to businessmen, depending on whether <PER>5ce4c6b48c5a90d8496dc446</PER>/<PER>5ce4c32e8c5a90d849649c8b</PER> runs a small or a big business venture. The travails of running a small business are compounded by the rampant corruption in the lower bureaucracy, <PER>5ce4c6b48c5a90d8496dc446</PER> said.<PER>5ce4c6b48c5a90d8496dc446</PER> pointed out that corruption, in the case of large businesses, is a different ballgame altogether, where discretionary powers, especially those relating to the allocation of natural resources such as land, minerals and radio spectrum, creates a nexus between businessmen on the one hand, and the bureaucracy and politicians on the other.The important difference between small and big arises from the fact that while big businesses are beneficiaries of favourable discretionary decisions, small businesses have to make payments to ensure their very survival, says <PER>5ce4c6b48c5a90d8496dc446</PER>.<PER>CHEREZAD RATAN BHARUCHA</PER>, former Chairman of <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG> (Karnataka), who heads a company that makes speciality fibres, is not gung-ho about the Anna Hazare campaign. <PER>CHEREZAD RATAN BHARUCHA</PER> says corruption has spread to the corporate sector. The campaign against corruption needs to also focus on strengthening existing institutions instead of vesting all power in an ultra powerful oversight body, <PER>CHEREZAD RATAN BHARUCHA</PER> said.More transparencyS. <PER>5ce4c30f8c5a90d84964558c</PER>, Chairman, CII Karnataka State Council and Managing Director, <ORG>5ce4c81e8c5a90d8497191be</ORG>, said industrialists are perturbed by the level of corruption. Clearly unwilling to take sides in the surcharged environment, <PER>5ce4c30f8c5a90d84964558c</PER> said: We are for a strong Lokpal Bill, but not necessarily for this or that version of the proposed legislation. <PER>5ce4c30f8c5a90d84964558c</PER> said businessmen face hazards when getting into lines of business involving natural resources. Asked whether the stepping down of B.S. Yeddyurappa from Chief Ministership has put greater pressure on the corrupt, <PER>5ce4c30f8c5a90d84964558c</PER> said: There has to be greater transparency.

RAJIV BAJAJ 	 BAJAJ AUTO LIMITED. 
 590392a07be9e0264d1d15c2 Take a look at The Indian Express power list of 2016-17 not just to see who are the most powerful 100 in this country of a billion plus. Look at it, also, to get a sense of how, over the past year, power has changed hands  and how power itself has changed. To take the second change first, which is also the context in which the first  the movement of the powerful  is to be tracked: More than any other in recent times, the past year has framed and sharpened an absence in Indias liberal democratic imagination.Liberal democracy in India has always seemed ill-trained in the art of separation that produces a check and balance on power, and is also a way of fragmenting it. Democracy in India doesnt ask itself the question, at least not often enough, and not with enough sophistication: What are the bases of different institutions? What are the different kinds of power?It is in this space of unasked questions that the steep climb and precipitous fall of individuals in the IE power list tells a story, of course.Large meanings can also be prised from the small shifts.All those who are on the list are there because of the individuals that they are and because of the institutions and offices that they represent. But the rise in the list of Chief <PER>5ce4c37b8c5a90d84965591e</PER>, from 41 to 4, and the entry of Dipak Misra at 15 and <PER>5ce4c8128c5a90d84971722a</PER> at 78, owes more to their institution  the judiciary  at a time when other checks and balances on concentrated executive power are waning. How these individuals act on their institutions, steer their course, will determine their ranking in next years list.And what about the non-political powerful of 2016-17?

 593a9cb67be9e07be66b53c8 An eight-member Israeli delegation on Thursday showcased its core strengths in a range of water treatment, purification and proofing technologies.Addressing the B2B meeting on Israeli Water Technology hosted by the <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG> (<ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG>), <PER>5ce4cae18c5a90d84978f56d</PER>, Consul for Economic Affairs, Consulate General of Israel, Mumbai, pointed out that Israel had developed water technology prowess by turning a resource challenge into an opportunity.Israel which is faced with a 45 per cent water deficit now manages to supply 250 litres of water daily to its over 7 million population by water management, water economy and water technology. In fact, over 75 per cent of the water is reused in the country.The available water is owned by the people but managed by the government, through its Water Authority and has administrative control over all aspects of water including consumption, allocation, production, pollution and pricing, <PER>5ce4cae18c5a90d84978f56d</PER> said.By 2013, over 70 per cent of drinking water in Israel would be supplied by the desalination plants, <PER>5ce4cae18c5a90d84978f56d</PER> said.Against a backdrop where most countries would only have half the requirements for water by 2030, water technologies could offer solutions, <PER>5ce4cae18c5a90d84978f56d</PER> said.G2G interfaceThe Consul later told The Hindu that a G2G interface is also proposed later this year where Israeli water technology experts would discuss avenues for collaboration with officials of the Tamil Nadu Government.Recently, the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade had inked MoU with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai on leveraging water technologies, including management and pricing, <PER>5ce4cae18c5a90d84978f56d</PER> said.According to the Consul, Israel which is renowned for water technologies such as smart irrigation solutions, water treatment, desalination and water security, had also led the change in the global approach to marketing new and innovative technologies in the water industry.All these technologies would be showcased at the biennial WATEC Israel 2011,' the sixth International exhibition and third International conference scheduled at Tel Aviv in November, <PER>5ce4cae18c5a90d84978f56d</PER> added.Multipronged approachS. <PER>DEVARAJU CHANDRAMOHAN RAJU</PER>, Co-chairman, Forum on Agriculture, <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG> Southern Region said though India was blessed with rains, rain water harvesting had to be made mandatory to ensure adequate water availability and supply in future. <PER>DEVARAJU CHANDRAMOHAN RAJU</PER> said there should be a multipronged approach to water issues involving all stakeholders like the government, citizens, farmers and industries, for better water management and more efficient water use.

 58fd67667be9e06c9371b4c1 KOCHI: Your mobile phone is also a bank. It can be used for purchasing things, making payments, tweeted Prime Minister <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645cd4</PER> recently. Now going by the trends post demonetisation, Keralites seem to have taken <PER>5ce4c3148c5a90d849645cd4</PER> words to their hearts as digital wallet firms such as Paytm, Mobikwik, Freecharge and Oxigen Wallet have made huge inroads in the state in the past few weeks. The overall traffic for Paytm in Kerala increased by 40 per cent after the demonetisation of high-value currencies by the Central Government and the offline transactions witnessed a 45 per cent growth spurt.The business of its rival Mobikwik has registered a phenomenal 15 times growth in the state. Freecharge and Oxigen Wallet are also garnering considerable business share in their rush to have a pie of the digital payment market in the state. These digital wallets provide the provision to pay at petrol pumps, chemists, phone recharging, grocery stores, parking, shopping, travelling by bus, auto and taxis and much more. With the recent RBI decision to increase the limits on wallets to Rs 20,000 for users and to Rs 50,000 for merchant bank transfers, players expect a deeper penetration into the pockets in the state.The cash-strapped consumers across Kerala are using Paytm as an alternative to queuing up for long hours outside ATMs. Be it while savouring delicious Kerala delicacies or shopping at malls or local kiranas, consumers across the state are now realising Paytms diverse use-cases. The time is here for the people of Kerala to educate each other about the benefits of cashless transactions and help India leapfrog from cash payments to quick and easy mobile payments, said <PER>5ce4c5048c5a90d84969603d</PER>, Deputy General Manager, Paytm.Among cities in Kerala, Kochi, a hot-spot for growth, shows some significant month-on-month traction on switching to the digital payment system, followed by Thiruvananthapuram.Another payment system, Unified Payment Interface (UPI), is yet to get the support of most supermarkets and retail stores. The surge in transactions from Kerala has been phenomenal. We have recorded a 15 times growth here. Demonetisation has impacted masses and we are aware that mobile wallets have to move at light speed to resolve the issues arising due to cash crunch. The cash blues have prompted the masses to shift to mobile wallet payments to overcome the challenges, said <PER>5ce4c5048c5a90d84969603b</PER>, Chief Operating Officer, MobiKwik. <PER>5ce4c5048c5a90d84969603b</PER> revealed that the company will increase its on-ground workforce to 12,000 to educate local retailers and get them on board. According to <PER>SUNIL DEVICHAND SURANA</PER>, Deputy Managing Director, <ORG>EFIN SERVICES (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>the situation will stabilise to a new normal which should be at least 40-45 per cent more than that of the pre-demonetisation period. The average ticket size is also expected to jump by 50 per cent going forward as the people will be more comfortable using digital wallets for their cashless transactions, <PER>SUNIL DEVICHAND SURANA</PER> added.

Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha New Delhi, June 16: <ORG>TOYOTA KIRLOSKAR MOTOR PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> will miss its sales target in India for 2011 by about 10,000 units on account of the production cuts after the Japanese tsunami and earthquake in March. Earlier, we had set a target of 1,50,000 units for this year. Now that has been reduced to 1,40,000 units because of the one-month production cut following the tsunami in Japan, <PER>RAJDEEP SINGH NARAG</PER>, deputy managing director (marketing) of <ORG>TOYOTA KIRLOSKAR MOTOR PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, said today at the launch of a variant of the sedan, Corolla Altis. According to <PER>RAJDEEP SINGH NARAG</PER>, <ORG>TOYOTA KIRLOSKAR MOTOR PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> hopes to sell 60,000 units of the Etios and the upcoming small car Liva in 2011. For 2012, the car maker is looking to produce 2.1 lakh units. The company will introduce its small car Liva by the end of this month. The new Corolla Altis is available in both petrol and diesel variants and is priced between Rs 10.53 lakh and Rs 14.77 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). Since the launch of the first Corolla in India in 2003, we have been getting a very good response to the car. So far, we have sold 70,000 units of the car across the country, said <PER>5ce4c3a58c5a90d84965c4ae</PER>, managing director of <ORG>TOYOTA KIRLOSKAR MOTOR PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>. The company sold 10,400 units of the Altis in 2010 and expects to sell 11,500 units this year. From its two plants in India, <ORG>TOYOTA KIRLOSKAR MOTOR PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> aims to increase production to 2,10,000 units from 1,50,000. This, according to officials at <ORG>TOYOTA KIRLOSKAR MOTOR PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, will reduce the waiting period for the Altis, Etios and the Innova. When we launched the Etios, we had about six months of waiting period, which has come down to about two months now after the second shift of production in March. By the end of this month, it will come down to below one month, said <PER>RAJDEEP SINGH NARAG</PER>.

The Clinic will counsel and guide sports persons to a successful sporting career, help achieve their full potential, protect them against & minimise sporting injuries, aid to remain at the peak of the performance and prolong their career.Speaking on the occasion <PER>5ce4c4698c5a90d84967c66d</PER> said that the counseling varies for each individual sports person depending upon <PER>5ce4c4698c5a90d84967c66d</PER> body and special needs and therefore has to be tailor made. Therefore a made for all prescription cant fit everyone. As the country is inching towards making a mark at Olympics, there is a general dearth of sports medicine specialists and specialised Sports clinics like this. For a sports person to blossom to <PER>5ce4c4698c5a90d84967c66d</PER> full potential, its just not a good trainer who makes the difference, equally important is the role of sports medicine specialist to groom <PER>5ce4c4698c5a90d84967c66d</PER> into top athlete.In our city there are 30,000 kids involved in various sports, of which 90% are vitamin D and Vitamin B 12 deficient, which impacts their career in the long run, this is just one aspect but serves to highlight the woeful lack of sports medicine guidance amongst our budding sport persons.

KUMAR RAJAGOPALAN 	 RETAILERS ASSOCIATION'S SKILL COUNCIL OF INDIA 
 593d409f7be9e00dabcbe98d Have you got used to carrying your own shopping bag to the market? Looks like many shoppers have started doing that ever since the Ministry of Environment and Forests launched the go-green initiative a few months ago, which disallows giving away free plastic bags to customers. According to <PER>KUMAR RAJAGOPALAN</PER>, CEO, <ORG>RETAILERS ASSOCIATION'S SKILL COUNCIL OF INDIA</ORG> (RAI), which has enforced the rule for all its members, there has been a reduction of 56 per cent in the usage of plastic bags ever since shops started charging extra for them.This is based on a study conducted by RAI at all its member stores across the country. The study also sought opinion of shoppers on this initiative, where 65 per cent of people welcomed it. Of the remaining 35 per cent, 15 per cent felt that more time should have been given before charging a fee and the rest wanted alternatives to plastic carry bags at stores. Retailers, however, say there is a long way to go before this move can bring an impact to the environment. We are going to impact only five per cent of the retail market, says <PER>KUMAR RAJAGOPALAN</PER>, adding that the highest support came from Andhra Pradesh where ban on plastic bags is strictly being enforced. RAI has over 700 retailers as members, with a good number of them in Tamil Nadu.While many retail chains in the city are charging a fee starting from Re. 1, enforcing them is a challenge. Store employees at Nilgiris Super Market, Kasturba Nagar say there is a reduction of only 10 per cent and many shoppers do not mind paying a few rupees more. A representative of Wills Lifestyle said that charging for plastic bags has cut consumption by 50 per cent at its outlets in the city. Many other stores are offering paper bags, cloth bags or jute bags as an alternative to plastic bags. A few of the Reliance Fresh outlets are packing vegetables in cartons.A recent study on Domestic Green Packaging Industry' by Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) also goes to show that a large number of domestic companies are opting for eco-friendly packaging. ASSOCHAM interacted with about 200 representatives in Chennai and nearly half of the manufacturers said they are increasingly adopting renewable packaging technologies, environmentally friendly light materials and cost-effective methods.Families too are finding a significant dip in the number of plastic carry bags stocked at homes. Previously, I used to give away plastic carry bags to my house maid, now I use them judiciously as the number of bags at home is reducing in number, said Sangeetha Niranjan Kumar, homemaker and a resident of Nungambakkam.Homemaker <PER>5ce4c8be8c5a90d849733feb</PER> makes sure she carries her cloth bags when she leaves home ever since stores implemented the rule. But the plastic littered over at dustbins has not at all reduced, <PER>5ce4c8be8c5a90d849733feb</PER> notes. Even your local stores should charge for plastic bags, only then will it be effective, adds <PER>5ce4c8be8c5a90d849733feb</PER>, a resident of <PER>5ce4ccd88c5a90d8497e5e0f</PER>. The real challenge is to see how cities are following. We plan to do a survey with the help of a research agency in every city, <PER>KUMAR RAJAGOPALAN</PER> added.

HANUMAN PRASAD 	 MYSORE RACE CLUB LIMITED. 
 593df5ea7be9e00dabcc6e90 The proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) on racing has evoked strong reactions from several leading race club managements in the country. The Hindu caught up with leaders of various clubs to get their views on racing being in the highest tax bracket of 28 per cent.<PER>5ce4c3288c5a90d849649071</PER>, Chairman, <ORG>5ce4c3418c5a90d84964c9c2</ORG>: All I can say is that those sitting in the GST Council have done injustice to racing. The Supreme Court has clearly said racing is a game of skill, and is not gambling.You cannot equate racing with lottery. Here we have trainers preparing expensive horses and jockeys riding them, there is a lot of skill involved.How can any race club in India pay 28 per cent tax? We will have to retrench 50 per cent staff and ultimately have to shut shop. Every race club in India provides jobs to around 10,000 people.<PER>5ce4c4408c5a90d8496758f4</PER>, Chairman, <ORG>5ce4c3788c5a90d8496550c9</ORG>: The entire racing industry was looking forward to a reasonable GST, at either 14 or 18 per cent. It is, however, a shock to the industry that it has been fixed at 28 per cent, the maximum slab possible.It is going to cause untold suffering in terms of hardship and employment of thousands of people dependent on racing in the country. Unless the GST council takes a pragmatic view and lowers the slab, the entire industry is doomed.As far as the <ORG>5ce4c3788c5a90d8496550c9</ORG> is concerned, we are already paying 26.25 per cent as taxes. So the impact is likely to be minimal as compared to the other race centres such as Mysore and Bangalore which are paying only four and eight per cent respectively.We, however, are looking forward to the final detail of what exactly the tax is going to be, whether on principal, on turnover, or the betting ticket. We also hope there would be no other cess or surcharges along with the taxes.<PER>5ce4ca0c8c5a90d84976d123</PER>, Chairman, <PER>5ce4ca0c8c5a90d84976d125</PER> India Turf Club: As you are aware, we have been working on getting favourable terms for the racing industry for several months.Turf Authorities of India (TAI) gave me the responsibility to lead the all-India delegation, and meetings were held with the Finance Minister as well as important bureaucrats in the GST Council. We also held meetings with the tax commissioners of all the major racing States and Finance Ministers of various racing States.The bureaucrats were presented with several facts about the industry: 1. Racing is a sport, 2. It is not a lottery, 3. The weighted average all-India betting tax is 7.5 per cent so anything higher would be detrimental and not revenue neutral, 4. A higher tax will result in a flight to illegal bookmakers.Our plea that the GST be charged on the earning (commission) and not face values does not seem to have found favour.We have not got the official notification whether the 28 per cent is on betting or on the race clubs other income. We also have to examine the benefit of input tax credit paid by RWITC, though it is not expected to be significant. There is ambiguity on whether tax on betting has been notified or not, and if there will be a separate classification for totalisator betting.A 28 per cent tax on betting, if final, will be disastrous for Mysore and Bangalore, but bad for the RWITC too.The sport is going through bad times and this will come as a further setback. A chairmans meeting has been called for next week to take stock of what the industry can do.<PER>HANUMAN PRASAD</PER>, Chairman, <ORG>MYSORE RACE CLUB LIMITED.</ORG>: We dont know what exactly it is going to be... whether it will be on commission value or the ticket value. If it is on commission value, then the race clubs can manage 28 per cent. But if it is on ticket value, they will really suffer. Unlike a lottery, where there is a single winner, there are multiple winners in racing. Lets say if horse No. 5 wins, there could be 5,000 or 10,000 people betting on that particular horse. Racing will be hit hard.<PER>5ce4cd308c5a90d8497f4efe</PER>, Chairman, Bangalore Race Club: We dont have any clarity yet. They have clubbed us together with cinema houses and luxury hotels. We have an entrance fee of Rs. 20 for the race club here, while a cinema house charges around Rs. 200 per ticket. I am still trying to find out the compete details.

 593c7ede7be9e00dabcb57ae The city, on Friday, hosted a seminar on its development, wherein speakers stressed the need to expedite the preparation of a master plan. The participants highlighted the need for a development package including better road connectivity and infrastructure improvement of suburban towns. The seminar, the first of a series named Emerging Trivandrum,' was organised in connection with the inauguration of the renovated Trivandrum Hotel at Statue here.BJP leader and former Union Minister <PER>5ce4c3eb8c5a90d8496672e8</PER> said, Thiruvananthapuram has always been known as one of the cleanest cities in the world. It is imperative that we maintain this lead. <PER>5ce4c3eb8c5a90d8496672e8</PER> also said that the city had good educational institutions, an advantage that could elevate it to an education hub. One of the major hindrances in the growth of this city is the road infrastructure. There is a need to work towards easing traffic congestion. One suggestion would be to set up a fly over from Kesavadasapuram to East Fort.Congress leader <PER>5ce4cc5c8c5a90d8497d04f6</PER> said that a high-level committee should be set up to monitor the capital's development. Better roads, flyovers, drainage, drinking water and solid waste disposal should be priority projects. Flooding of Thampanoor and East Fort during the monsoon remains a problem must be looked into. <PER>5ce4cc5c8c5a90d8497d04f6</PER> proposed a skywalk for easy commuting to bus stand and railway station. <PER>5ce4cc5c8c5a90d8497d04f6</PER> called for an alternative model focussing on the development of satellite towns in the suburbs instead of encouraging vertical growth of the city.Historian and chairman of the Vylopilly Samskrithi Bhavan, M.G. Sasibhooshan said that development should not be at the cost of the city's heritage and natural beauty. <PER>5ce4cc5c8c5a90d8497d04f6</PER> underlined the need to protect the rivers and ponds and preserve the ecological wealth of the city.<PER>5ce4c3eb8c5a90d8496672e8</PER> also proposed that the international airport be named after Sri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, the last ruler of erstwhile Travancore, who was instrumental in setting up the city's first airport. <PER>5ce4cbb68c5a90d8497b398c</PER>, president, Chamber of Commerce, suggested naming the domestic airport after G.V. Raja, who played a key role in setting up the Sports Council in Kerala.<PER>SURESH BABU THAMPI ACHUTHAN SYAMALA</PER>, CMD, <ORG>VIZHINJAM INTERNATIONAL SEAPORT LIMITED</ORG> said focus should be on the development of four sectors  IT/ITES services, health care, tourism and education.New-look hotelEarlier, Chief Minister <PER>5ce4c3018c5a90d849643414</PER> inaugurated the renovated Trivandrum Hotel.

The step has been taken to avoid complaints that the project is being delayed by the bureaucracy.The DMRCs threat of closing down its offices in the capital and Kozhikode in view of the delay in the kick-off of the project is also another reason for the Chief Ministers swift action.The DMRC has already scaled down the number of personnel. The government order in this regard needs to be issued, sources said. Rolling stock design finalisation and invitation of bids, preparation of details of land acquisition, estimates and drawings and plan of the flyovers, proposals for utility shifting and road diversion management figure in the interim consultancy.The State has already approached the Union Urban Development Ministry for in-principle approval for the Light Metro, participation of the Centre and 20 per cent equity contribution.The DPR prepared by the DMRC and the Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP), a prerequisite for getting financial assistance, prepared by NATPAC had also been submitted. The DMRC wanted to get clearances and to commence the work at the earliest to avoid cost escalation, but the <ORG>KERALA RAPID TRANSIT CORPORATION LIMITED</ORG> was not expediting the project, official sources said.Mr. Sreedharans request to the Chief Minister to post a full-time Managing Director to <ORG>KERALA RAPID TRANSIT CORPORATION LIMITED</ORG> by open advertisement and other demands is yet to be implemented.The Chief Minister, who is also the KRTCL chairman, corrected the minutes to give approval to the DMRCs request for interim consultancy.

Work at these mines, however, has been held up due to litigations related to temples, boundary disputes and forest land.The government has been urged to take appropriate steps for the early disposal of these cases.Even two months after the Supreme Court direction, the committee to determine compensatory payment for B category mines has not been constituted.The opening of B category mines is vital to the industry as the annual permissible production is larger, <PER>VINOD TOLAMBIA</PER> said.The government should convene a meeting of leaseholders of all B category mines, clarify the related issues and ensure that they start mining soon, <PER>VINOD TOLAMBIA</PER> said.Earlier, a delegation of KISMA representatives led by <PER>VINOD TOLAMBIA</PER> had met Chief Secretary S V Ranganath in tconnection with this issue.

 593c80f57be9e00dabcb597c Latin America (Latam) and Japan are emerging as major markets for the Indian IT industry in the wake of the downward trend in the U.<PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER> and Europe, according to <PER>5ce4cc5e8c5a90d8497d0a38</PER>, Executive Director, <ORG>SHELLAC AND FOREST PRODUCTS EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL</ORG> (<ORG>SHELLAC AND FOREST PRODUCTS EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL</ORG>), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Technology.<PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER> said that even as efforts were being made by the <ORG>SHELLAC AND FOREST PRODUCTS EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL</ORG> over the last few years to diversify Indian IT export markets beyond the traditional base, it now appears that these regions along with Africa were well poised to become the main markets in future. Talking to this correspondent he said that these markets were being serviced by the companies in the U.<PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER> and the U.K., Spain, Germany and France through India. Naturally, the clients there were now finding it worthwhile to do direct business as it worked out cheaper.The Latam countries now in focus were: Brazil, Panama, Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Peru, <PER>5ce4cc5e8c5a90d8497d0a38</PER> said. These nations have a capacity of replacing the U.<PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER> market, <PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER> said. The <ORG>SHELLAC AND FOREST PRODUCTS EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL</ORG> is also upbeat about the Japanese market. It is the single largest IT market after the U.<PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER> and India has a mere 2 per cent share of this market. <PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER> said that the free trade agreement between the two countries, if realised, would provide further headway to Indian IT exporters. Africa too held promise, <PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER> felt. <PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER>, Chairman, <ORG>SHELLAC AND FOREST PRODUCTS EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL</ORG>, said that to stay ahead in the fast changing global IT landscape, India had to re-strategise its plans and widen the basket of its export destinations. <PER>5ce4cc5e8c5a90d8497d0a38</PER> said that while the 30 per cent growth rates of pre-2008 years could not be achieved, the 10 per cent growth rate being targeted for this year would be met.<PER>SUSHIL RADHAKISHAN KEJRIWAL</PER> said India's ICT exports would be around $75 billion against $65.28 billion in 2010-11.

Making a presentation on Safety Measures at Nuclear Plants' at Urja Bhawan, <PER>5ce4cb3f8c5a90d84979eb80</PER> asserted, India will never face a Japan-like situation after an earthquake and tsunami as there is a lot of geographical difference between the two countries.''Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries as it falls in the high Zone Five of the earthquake-prone region. The recent earthquake in Japan was of nine magnitude in Richter scale.Stating that India falls under Zone Three, <PER>5ce4cb3f8c5a90d84979eb80</PER> said that the main earthquake belt comprised the North-East region and the upper areas of the Himalayas.Since most of the nuclear plants are about 900 to 1,300 km away from this earthquake belt, these are fully safe, <PER>5ce4cb3f8c5a90d84979eb80</PER> said.<PER>5ce4cb3f8c5a90d84979eb80</PER> added that the first nuclear plant was set up in India in 1969 and since then it had been working smoothly. Now the Corporation had adopted the policy to set up nuclear plants of 700 MW.In <ORG>HARYANA POWER GENERATION CORPORATION LTD</ORG> also, four nuclear plants each of 700 MW would be set up at Gorakhpur in Fatehabad district.The Centre has constituted a high-powered committee to review the safety of nuclear plants in the country. The Corporation had also constituted a work force at its own level. And the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) were also reviewing the plants, <PER>5ce4cb3f8c5a90d84979eb80</PER> added.<PER>Sanjeev Kumar Kaushal</PER>, Managing Director of <ORG>HARYANA POWER GENERATION CORPORATION LTD</ORG>, said the sanction for the nuclear plants at Gorakhpur in Fatehabad had been granted in 1984 by the then <ORG>HARYANA POWER GENERATION CORPORATION LTD</ORG> Government, and thereafter, successive governments had approved it. There is no political dispute about the location of the plant,'' <PER>Sanjeev Kumar Kaushal</PER> claimed while stating that surveys were carried out in 2000-01, 2004 and 2007, and notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued on July 29, 2010.<PER>Sanjeev Kumar Kaushal</PER> further disclosed that notification under Section 6 would probably be issued on July 28, 2011.Farmers of Gorakhpur have been sitting on dharna outside the Mini-Secretariat in Fatehabad for more than 200 days now protesting against the acquisition of their fertile land for the nuclear plants. Concern has also been voiced over the safety aspects.However, <PER>Sanjeev Kumar Kaushal</PER> said, In all, 1,503.4 acres of land would be acquired for this purpose out of which 1,313.46 acres was in Gorakhpur and Kajadhedi. About 38 acres was panchayati and shamalat land which was under government control. No forest or residential land formed part of it. The people of Fatehabad have given letters of oath for 900 acres to the Deputy Commissioner and they have welcomed the decision to set up the nuclear plants.'' <PER>Sanjeev Kumar Kaushal</PER> further said that 191 objections had been received which would be given a hearing.

Picture by UB Photos Shillong, Aug. 19: Land acquisition has been a major challenge for those who wish to invest in the Northeast. However, the <ORG>5ce4c7a48c5a90d849705021</ORG> today said it was ready to give land as long as investment flows into the state. Meghalaya has an intricate land tenure system, as a major portion of the land belongs to the community and not the <ORG>5ce4c7a48c5a90d849705021</ORG>. Over the years, the convoluted system has also been seen as a major constraint, even in safeguarding catchment areas which are slowly but steadily drying up. Speaking at the investors meet organised by the <ORG>INDIA-KUWAIT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE</ORG> (<ORG>INDIA-KUWAIT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE</ORG>) here, deputy chief minister <PER>5ce4cd048c5a90d8497ed7ae</PER>5a90d8496c68ea</PER> appealed to investors from the infrastructure sector to develop low-cost superior housing and dwelling facilities at the New Shillong township. <PER>5ce4cd048c5a90d8497ed7ae</PER>ER>5ce4c62f8c5a90d8496c68ea</PER> also said the <ORG>5ce4c7a48c5a90d849705021</ORG> was eager to provide land within the framework of local laws. Give us good houses, we will give you land, <PER>5ce4c62f8c5a90d8496c68ea</PER> said, downplaying all misinformation about the state. <PER>5ce4c62f8c5a90d8496c68ea</PER> also asked investors to convert their words into action and respect local sentiments. The participants included those who had expressed interest to invest in Meghalaya at the ICCs sixth Northeast Business Summit in Mumbai held in January this year. More than 70 investors from the Northeast and 25 investors from the rest of the country, and 50 government officials attended todays meet. <PER>5ce4c62f8c5a90d8496c68ea</PER> also said, When there is investment flowing into the state, there are no issues of land allocation for large, medium and small scale industries. <PER>5ce4c62f8c5a90d8496c68ea</PER> was replying to a query made by an investor in the cement, iron and steel sector. Tourism, being a major sector of investment in Meghalaya, <PER>5ce4c62f8c5a90d8496c68ea</PER> requested investors in construction and hospitality segments to construct superior resorts and star-category hotels in and around tourist destinations in the state. Speaking to reporters, <PER>RAJEEV SINGH TYAGI</PER>, <ORG>INDIA-KUWAIT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE</ORG> director-general, said land acquisition and power scarcity are the two major challenges for those who want to invest in the Northeast. Investors from outside the state are confronted with the twin issues of land acquisition and power scarcity. These issues need to be addressed properly, <PER>RAJEEV SINGH TYAGI</PER> said. On the law and order scenario in the region, <PER>RAJEEV SINGH TYAGI</PER> said the same has substantially improved compared to earlier years. <PER>RAJEEV SINGH TYAGI</PER> also said since 2001, when the <ORG>INDIA-KUWAIT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE</ORG> took the initiative to organise the Northeast Business Summits, an amount of Rs 6,900 crore had come to the region as investment in various segments. We expect that Rs 7,000 crore more will flow into the Northeast in the next few years, <PER>RAJEEV SINGH TYAGI</PER> added. On Meghalaya, <PER>RAJEEV SINGH TYAGI</PER> said the state has the potential to attract a total investment of about Rs 4,000 from various investors. However, <PER>RAJEEV SINGH TYAGI</PER> was quick to add that the state government has to do its bit to promptly provide clearance to the investments. Linking investment in the region with the Look East Policy, <PER>RAJEEV SINGH TYAGI</PER> said the <ORG>INDIA-KUWAIT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE</ORG> foresees the Northeast as a major trading hub between India and countries located in Southeast Asia.

HARKANWAL SINGH WADHWA 	 AZURE POWER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED 
 58feee5c7be9e04117d233dc Solar power is a clean energy source. But in the arid part of northwest India it can also be a dusty one.Every five days or so, in a marriage of low and high tech, field hands with long-handled dust mops wipe down each of the 36,000 solar panels at a 63-acre installation operated by <ORG>AZURE POWER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>. The site is one of the biggest examples of India's ambitious plan to use solar energy to help modernise its notoriously underpowered national electricity grid and reduce its dependence on coal-fired power plants.<ORG>AZURE POWER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> has a contract to provide solar-generated electricity to a State-government electric utility. <PER>HARKANWAL SINGH WADHWA</PER>, <ORG>AZURE POWER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>'s chief executive, predicted that within a few years solar power would be competitive in price with conventionally generated electricity.The efficiency of solar technology will continue to increase, and with the increasing demand in solar energy, cost will continue to decrease, <PER>HARKANWAL SINGH WADHWA</PER> said.Setting the targetTwo years ago, Indian policymakers said that by the year 2020 they would drastically increase the nation's use of solar power from virtually nothing to 20,000 megawatts enough electricity to power the equivalent of 20 million modern U.S. homes. Many analysts said it could not be done. But, now the doubters are taking back their words.Dozens of developers like <ORG>AZURE POWER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, because of aggressive government subsidies and a large drop in the global price of solar panels, are covering the north-western plains including this village of 2,000 people with gleaming solar panels.So far, India uses only about 140 megawatts, including 10 megawatts used by the <ORG>AZURE POWER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> installation, which can provide enough power to serve a town of 50,000 people, according to the company. But analysts say the national 20,000 megawatt goal is achievable, and India could reach those numbers even a few years before 2020.Prices came down and suddenly things were possible that didn't seem possible, said <PER>5ce4c62e8c5a90d8496c6618</PER>, managing director of Bridge to India, a research and consulting firm based in New Delhi.Chinese manufacturers like Suntech Power and Yingli Green Energy helped drive the drop in solar-panel costs. The firms aggressively increased production of the panels and cut costs this year by about 30 per cent to 40 per cent, to less than $1 a watt.Developers of solar farms in India, however, have shown a preference for the more advanced, so-called thin-film solar cells offered by suppliers in the United States, Taiwan and Europe. The leading U.S. provider to India is First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona.India does not have a large solar manufacturing industry, but is trying to develop one, and China is showing a new interest in India's growing demand. China's Suntech Power sold the panels used at the <ORG>AZURE POWER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> installation, which opened in June.Industry executives credit government policies with India's solar boom, unusual praise because businesses usually deride Indian regulations as Kafkaesque.Opening upOver the last decade, India has opened the state-dominated power-generating industry to private players, while leaving transmission, distribution and rate-setting largely in government hands. European countries heavily subsidise expensive solar power by agreeing to buy it for decades at a time, but the subsidies in India are much lower and solar operators are forced into greater competition, helping push down costs.This month, the government held its second auction to determine the price at which its state-owned power trading company NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam would buy solar-generated electricity for the national grid. The average winning bid was Rs.8.77 (16.5 cents) per kilowatt hour.That is about twice the price of coal-generated power, but it was about 27 per cent lower than the winning bids at the first auction held a year ago. Germany, the world's biggest solar-power user, pays about 17.94 euro cents (23 U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour.India, to be sure, still significantly lags behind European countries in the use of solar. Germany, for example, had 17,000 megawatts of solar-power capacity at the end of 2010. But India, which gets more than 300 days of sunlight a year, is a far more suitable place to generate solar power. And being behind is now benefiting India, as panel prices plummet, enabling it to spend far less to set up solar farms than countries that pioneered the technology.Eye on futureIn its solar-power auctions, moreover, NTPC is not creating open-ended contracts. The last auction, for example, was for a total of only 350 megawatts, which will cap the government's costs. The assumption is that the price of solar power will continue to decline, eventually approaching the cost of electricity generated through conventional methods.Most Indian power plants are fuelled by coal and generate electricity at about four rupees per kilowatt hour. Yet, even in this month's auction, the recent winning bids were already comparable to what India's industrial and commercial users actually pay for electricity  from eight to 10 rupees. And solar's costs are competitive with power plants and back-up generators that burn petroleum-based fuels, whose electricity costs about Rs.10 per kilowatt hour.At least during daytime, photovoltaic panels will compete with oil-generated electricity more than anything else in India, said <PER>5ce4c62e8c5a90d8496c6615</PER>, a senior analyst at the International Energy Agency in Paris. This comparison is becoming better and better every month.In addition to the federal government, several of India's states like Gujarat, where Khadoda is located, are also buying power at subsidised rates from solar companies like <ORG>AZURE POWER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>.Analysts do not expect India's solar rollout to be problem-free. They say some developers have probably bid too aggressively in the federal auctions and may not be able to build their plants fast enough or at low enough cost to survive.Consequently, or because their bids were merely speculative, some developers are trying to sell their government power agreements to third parties, analysts say, even though such flipping is against the auction rules.<PER>HARKANWAL SINGH WADHWA</PER>, of <ORG>AZURE POWER INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, said that a solar-industry shakeout in India was almost inevitable.Initially, a lot of new players enter the sector, <PER>HARKANWAL SINGH WADHWA</PER> said, and then the market settles with a few players who have a long-term commitment to the industry.  New York Times News ServiceFriendly policies and dropping prices have brought the goal of generating20,000 megawatts of solar power in India by 2020 closer to reality.

 58fd889f7be9e012bf282f0f Telangana: A large number of ATMs in the city remained dysfunctional as the re-caliberation process drags on.CHENNAI: With the government nudging people towards digital banking modes -- payments through mobile phones, Point of Sale (PoS) machines and others -- ATM players may find their business in a flux in the coming years.ATMs are cash-vending machines and operators are paid on a per transaction basis.While some industry insiders see a plateauing of demand for ATMs because of the various other payment modes that will come into play in the near future, others are sanguine about the continued demand for the cash-dispensing machines.According to <PER>5ce4c3718c5a90d849654062</PER>, President, <ORG>5ce4c5298c5a90d84969c5eb</ORG> and Systems (FSS), the demand for ATMs is unlikely to be affected in the next couple of years, but "it is not possible to make a growth estimate after two years given the changed situation".On the other hand, <PER>SRINIVAS KOLLAPUDI</PER>, Managing Director and CEO of <ORG>BTI PAYMENTS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, said ATM numbers in India would grow for the next 15-20 years.As <PER>SRINIVAS KOLLAPUDI</PER> pointed out, the US, with a population of around 320 million, has some 432,000 ATMs, while India, with a population four times that has only around 220,000. There are thousands of Indian villages that do not have even one such machine, <PER>SRINIVAS KOLLAPUDI</PER> added, suggesting huge headroom for growth."Even in the most advanced countries, where digital banking is popular, cash transactions still take place. Over a period of time ATM players will also rediscover themselves and offer additional services," <PER>SRINIVAS KOLLAPUDI</PER> said.According to <PER>SRINIVAS KOLLAPUDI</PER>, the increase in PoS terminals will not pose a major threat to ATM players, while <PER>5ce4c3718c5a90d849654062</PER> said one problem with rural areas migrating to mobile payments in large numbers is that not many have smartphones.The government, however, is pushing hard for higher penetration of digital banking so that the nation moves towards a cashless economy.According to a report prepared by SBI's Group Chief Economic Advisor <PER>5ce4c44d8c5a90d849677cad</PER>, there is excess of Rs 5 lakh crore cash in circulation which is "neither required nor desirable" and that a digital economy needs to be encouraged."The current size of digital banking (including credit cards, debit card transactions through PoS terminals, transactions through prepaid payment instruments like m-Wallets, and mobile banking) is around Rs 1.2 lakh crore," <PER>5ce4c3718c5a90d849654062</PER> said in the report.According to <PER>5ce4c44d8c5a90d849677cad</PER>, if the size of digital banking were to increase to Rs 3 lakh crore, there was a need for around 20 million extra PoS terminals."Further, we have to ensure that per mobile banking transactions increase from Rs 10,000 (in September 2016) to Rs 25,000 monthly. Mobile wallet transactions need to increase from current level of Rs 32 billion to around Rs 100 billion going forward," the report said."This means that value per transaction needs to increase significantly from the current level of a mere Rs 425 to around Rs 1,000," the report added.According to the report, the government should also look at specifying a certain limit for digital transactions for individuals that could be available for tax deduction.These may be akin to tax rebates given under section 80C of the Income Tax Act.The other measures suggested are banning all cash transactions for government services, mandatory installation of PoS machines at merchant outlets and making PAN details mandatory for any cash transaction above a specified limit.

FPCs had started procurement centres in the tur growing district, which they are handing over to the SFAC at regular intervals. The procurement centres too, have set up cleaning and grading centres, which helps them in meeting the set Fair and Average Quality (FAQ) norms.Watch What Else Is Making News:In view of the 20 per cent increase in tur acreage in the state, prices of the commodity has been volatile. Increased arrival has resulted in a slump in prices and the tur has been trading below the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,050 in most markets. Low prices had, in fact, led to distress sale as farmers offloaded their stock in fear of further price drop. We have been purchasing the produce at stipulated MSP and the message has gone through. In many of the centres, the price of tur has increased between Rs 200-300 per quintal at the wholesale markets, <PER>5ce4c81f8c5a90d8497194e3</PER> said.<PER>5ce4c81f8c5a90d8497194e3</PER> said such procurement centres have stopped the distress sale of tur and allowed farmers to stop the distress sale of the commodity.The records released by the <ORG>INDIA PULSES AND GRAINS ASSOCIATION</ORG> (<ORG>INDIA PULSES AND GRAINS ASSOCIATION</ORG>) for the months of October, November and December, showed that more than 24 lakh MT of imported daals had arrived in the country.

One donor can possibly give the gift of life to many terminally-ill patients.To commemorate World Kidney Day on Thursday, Manipal Hospital observed the international slogan Donate Kidneys for Life Receive, which focused on the positive outcome of kidney transplantation.Dr H <PER>SUDARSHAN LAL BALUJA</PER>, Medical Director, <ORG>MANIPAL HEALTH SYSTEMS PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, said that every year about two lakh people are diagnosed with kidney failure, but due to the non-availability of organs, only 2,500-odd kidney transplants are done annually.Being a country with a population of over 1.2 billion people, India still lags behind in cadaver donation programme (organ transplant from a brain dead donor). Despite the passing of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act by the Indian government in 1994, there is little empathy towards it.There is a need to create awareness on cadaver organ donation, counselling of relatives for organ donation in the event of brain death, adequate hospital infrastructure, matching and distribution of the organs and co-ordination amongst hospitals to meet the staggering number of organ donations required to save lives, <PER>SUDARSHAN LAL BALUJA</PER> added.

 590366317be9e02646bd4199 IGI airport scare: No radioactive leak, say AERB, Delhi govtNew Delhi, May 29, 2015 (PTI) 20:28 ISTCargo operations were temporarily suspended and staff was evacuated today from the cargo area following a radiation scare at the international airport here but authorities later declared that there was no radioactive leakage.Hours after NDRF and airport authorities suspected a radioactive leak at IGI Airport, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) team found that an "organic liquid" from another consignment had spilled over the cargo containing nuclear medicine and it was initially thought that the leakage was from that package."After conducting the probe at the site, we can confirm that there is no radioactive leakage. The leakage on the consignment was a spill-over from another consignment. It is some organic liquid. This resulted in wetness (of the Turkish consignment)," AERB Vice-Chairman R <PER>5ce4c33a8c5a90d84964b830</PER> told PTI.The authorities at the airport had cordoned off the cargo area and all the staff have been evacuated. Cargo operations were also suspended as a precautionary measure.The matter came to light when a pair of loaders felt irritation while handling containers that arrived on board a Turkish Airlines craft at 4:35 AM. Leakage was observed from four of the 10 containers of 13 kg each that were imported from Turkey.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was called in to check the substance, sources said.District magistrate of New Delhi <PER>SANJAY KUMAR SINGH</PER> also confirmed that there was no leakage of radioactive material at the airport."It has been officially declared that there was no radioactive substance leak. A box containing a liquid was placed above the container having the radioactive material."The box got damaged and the liquid got spilled over the container having the radioactive material. The is no need to panic," <PER>SANJAY KUMAR SINGH</PER> said.Some packets were found wet and the cargo staff thought that it may be due to leakage from the consignment, <PER>SANJAY KUMAR SINGH</PER> said."The consignment was marked as 'Radioactive Material Type A Package' and hence all agencies concerned including AERB and Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS) were informed. The teams from AERB and INMAS declared that there was no radioactive leakage," <PER>SANJAY KUMAR SINGH</PER> said.Earlier, the <ORG>DELHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, said in a statement that there was no risk of exposure to any passenger as the area where the incident was reported far away from any of the passenger terminals.Aviation regulator DGCA had also launched a probe into the incident.

 593aa41b7be9e003363db1fc Automobile majors should appoint Indian firms as tier-I supplier so that Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can reap the benefits, said <PER>5ce4caf58c5a90d8497927d9</PER>, president, Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturers' Association (AIEMA) on Friday.Taking part in the third edition of Engineering Expo, <PER>5ce4caf58c5a90d8497927d9</PER> said pushing Indian ancillary companies to the second and third tier would deprive them of the opportunity to supply the desired quantities to the auto majors, as they would be in total control of tier-I firms, and this was a dangerous trend.It is an emerging trend and we have requested the State and Central governments to look into this issue to find an amicable solution, <PER>5ce4caf58c5a90d8497927d9</PER> said. About 200 companies are taking part in the three-day fair from different verticals such as machine tools and accessories, electrical and electronics, logistics and material handling, IT, software, CAD/CAM, hydraulics and pneumatics, testing and measuring equipment and power supply products to showcase some of the pioneering engineering solutions and technologies.Talking to newsmen, Infomedia CEOPublishing, <PER>5ce4caf58c5a90d8497927db</PER>, said about four to five expos were held each year and plans were on to add about 20 to 25 centres in the next five years in places such as Rudrapur, Nasik and Coimbatore.

Accreditation and evaluation were basic for ensuring quality and this should be done by professionals. Secondly, The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill too was pending. Collection of capitation fee and other ills prevailing in universities could be done away with and there were provisions to levy a penalty upto Rs.50 lakh, <PER>POTTAYIL MADHAVA MENON</PER> pointed.The Educational Tribunals Bill and the Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operations) Bill too were pending in Parliament, <PER>POTTAYIL MADHAVA MENON</PER> said, appealing to the <ORG>CONFEDERATION OF INDIAN INTERNET COMMERCE</ORG> and its members to lobby for passing these Bills as vested interests were preventing them from being enacted.Stating that the present system of university education was inhibiting innovation, <PER>POTTAYIL MADHAVA MENON</PER> said courses designed by educational institutions under the influence of market forces and for fetching jobs for students were wrong.

Photo: Special ArrangementWith a view to enhancing biomass-based power generation through energy plantations, Chennai-based <ORG>AURO MIRA ENERGY COMPANY PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> has entered into a memorandum of agreement (MoA) with the Forest College and Research Institute (FCRI) of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), here on Thursday.With biomass-based power generation plants in Tamil Nadu, the company is interested in promoting energy plantations through contract farming with a view to developing its fuel resources. Under the aegis of the MoA, a contract energy tree farming programme for augmenting biomass-based power generation was launched at the FCRI by <PER>5ce4c3668c5a90d84965245a</PER>, Vice-Chancellor of TNAU. For the first-of-its-kind project in the State, which is funded by <ORG>AURO MIRA ENERGY COMPANY PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, FCRI will be the facilitator between the farmers who will grow the energy trees, and the company.Inking the MoA, <PER>SURESH KAMAT GUNDITHODI BABU</PER>, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, <ORG>AURO MIRA ENERGY COMPANY PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, said the country had the potential to generate much power from biomass. But now, due to dearth in biomass resources, the production was not very high.There was an uncertainty in production because of the shortage in raw material. Best tree varieties with more calorific value developed by TNAU would be passed on to farmers. Site-specific varieties and technologies would also be identified by the university for the purpose. The company in turn would ensure a competitive price for the produce, <PER>SURESH KAMAT GUNDITHODI BABU</PER> added. To begin with, the university had identified 100 acres as biomass garden where farmers would grow energy trees. TNAU would provide the necessary inputs in the form of saplings and technology till harvesting.<PER>5ce4c3668c5a90d84965245a</PER> said the power requirement of Tamil Nadu was 9,200 MW. But the present generation capacity was only 7,300 MW. There was a shortfall of at least 2,000 MW power.It is not enough to meet this demand by only depending on the conventional sources of power. There are at least 14 plants that generate power using biomass resources. But they are not able to generate to their full capacity because of the shortage in raw materials. The contract energy tree farming programme will provide these power plants with the necessary varieties to use as raw materials, <PER>5ce4c3668c5a90d84965245a</PER> said.The Vice-Chancellor added that model farms of 100 acres each would be identified as biomass gardens in other districts too for the implementation of the programme.The university also planned for capacity building for farmers involved in cultivating energy trees in the form of training programmes in various locations.P. Durairasu, Dean (Forestry), FCRI, inked the MoA on behalf of the institute.

SANDEEP GHOSH 	 RELIANCE CAPITAL LIMITED 
 593d81a77be9e018040298a9 Mumbai, Aug. 29: The Reserve Bank of India today laid out tough ground rules for issuing new banking licences, making it clear that it would be looking to cherry pick industrial houses with squeaky clean reputations, diversified ownership, and with little or no exposure to the real estate and broking businesses. The big surprise was the decision to put broking outfits on the negative list along with real estate barons. A number of non-banking finance companies  which have been salivating at the prospect of turning into full-fledged banks  may find their chances of grabbing one of the licences at stake scuppered by this provision since they all have broking arms. In the draft guidelines put out today, the RBI said certain activities such as real estate and dealings in capital market, particularly broking activities, were riskier and represent a business model and culture which are misaligned with a banking model. It noted that after the 2008 global credit crisis, there were concerted moves to re-establish the Chinese wall between banking and proprietary trading, which was first established in the US under the Glass-Steagall Act four years after the Great Crash of 1929. The provision was repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999 and has been blamed for the latest financial crisis by allowing Wall Street investment banking outfits to play around with depositors money held in banks owned or created by these investment firms. It will, therefore, be necessary to ensure that any entity/ group undertaking such activities on a significant scale is not considered for a bank licence. Otherwise, there will be real risks of the same business approach getting transmitted to the banks as well, the central bank cautioned. It said entities or groups that have significant (10 per cent or more) income or assets or both from such real estate construction and broking taken together in the last three years will not be eligible. Analysts fear this proviso could bar entities such as Religare Enterprises and <ORG>5ce4c3298c5a90d8496493ba</ORG> to set up banks. Diversified conglomerates such as the Aditya Birla or <PER>5ce4ccfc8c5a90d8497ec3d2</PER> groups also have broking arms in their NBFCs. However, a source from the Anil Ambani group said this guideline would not hurt its chances since its income from broking was not large. But that wasnt the only surprise. The draft guidelines also said promoters or groups with diversified ownership would be eligible to promote banks. However, the RBI did not explain what it meant by diversified ownership. Some reckon that this could improve the chances of groups such as Larsen & Toubro to foray into banking since it has a well-diversified ownership structure. But the real joker in the pack is the proviso that entitles the RBI to run a detailed background check on the applicants with other regulators and enforcement and investigative agencies such as the income tax department, the CBI or the Enforcement Directorate. Several industrial houses and top-tier companies have been sucked into controversial investigations into their commercial transactions, deals and tax enquiries that have eventually landed in courts. This can become the biggest litmus test that the banking licence hopefuls will need to pass. Those wanting to set up a bank will have to first establish a wholly owned Non-Operative Holding Company, which will hold the bank as well as all the other financial services companies. This has been done to ring fence the regulated financial services activities of the group, including the new bank, from the other activities of the promoter group. The corporate structure has been designed to stop the promoter from treating the bank as a private cash trove for the advancement of <PER>5ce4ccfc8c5a90d8497ec3d2</PER> business interests. The RBI said the licences would be issued on a very selective basis to those that meet its requirements (see chart) and it may not be possible to issue licences to all the applicants meeting the eligibility criteria. <PER>SANDEEP GHOSH</PER>, CEO of <ORG>RELIANCE CAPITAL LIMITED</ORG>, said the draft contains a strong focus on greater financial inclusion, efficient corporate governance, adequate controls on exposure to group companies, and time-bound milestones for listing. <ORG>RELIANCE CAPITAL LIMITED</ORG> is one of the strong aspirants for a banking licence.

ANJU AUDUTH TIMBLO 	 S-FOMENTO RESOURCES PRIVATE LIMITED 
 593db19e7be9e00dabcc36a5 The Goa Mineral Ore Exporters' Association (GMOEA), a body representing iron ore exporters, on Monday said they did not know if there was any foreign funding behind all the activism against Goa mining.According to a release issued here by the association, <PER>5ce4c5f38c5a90d8496bd350</PER>c5a90d8496bd350</ORG>, Managing Director, SesaGoa Limited, who is an office-bearer of GMOEA, said the association did not deny that there were certain illegalities in mining sector in Goa and in particular in the spectrum of exports in this State.However, a blanket ban on the industry could never be a solution since it would lead to destabilisation of Goa's economic apparatus.<PER>5ce4c5f38c5a90d8496bd350</PER> said that in fact the industry itself wanted the black sheep to be identified and brought to justice and as such it believed that that there was an urgent need to strengthen the monitoring apparatus under the regulations for all activities related to mining, transportation, and exports.MonitoringOnce proper systems and accountability for monitoring are in place, all offenders will be automatically identified and eradicated. These social and economic dimensions need to be addressed before arriving at any decision about the future of this industry, <PER>5ce4c5f38c5a90d8496bd350</PER> said.Goa miners will lose markets in Japan, Korea, and Europe and so on, besides China, established over decades of efforts.We do not know if there is any foreign funding behind all the activism against Goa mining.When the country wants to invite huge investment in the mining sector through various provisions in the proposed MMRD Act, such negative painting of all miners with the same brush (sic) may do more harm than good in the medium to long term, <PER>5ce4c5f38c5a90d8496bd350</PER> added.DisasterAmbar <PER>ANJU AUDUTH TIMBLO</PER>, Managing Director of <ORG>S-FOMENTO RESOURCES PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, said that at a time when the Indian economy was grappling with recession and domestic inflation, the Goa mining industry collapse would spell disaster and any intent to impose ban on mining activities in Goa would lead to collapse of the State economy.All trucks and barges will be redundant with corresponding effect on livelihood of about half a million people, <PER>ANJU AUDUTH TIMBLO</PER> said.Stating that traditionally, the iron ore industry in Goa had been export oriented, <PER>5ce4cd178c5a90d8497f0bb3</PER>, president of GMOEA, said that over the last few years, with a surge in demand from China, the industry had grown at a fanatic pace.This had led to a host of traders and fly-by-night operators who entered the industry with a short term profit motive and paid scant regard to accountability, sustainability, infrastructure, and environmental concerns.This, to a great extent, had tarnished the image of iron ore mining in the State and brought disrepute to the entire industry, <PER>5ce4cd178c5a90d8497f0bb3</PER> said.

PRASHANT BANGUR 	 SHREE CEMENT LIMITED 
 593d92f27be9e00dabcc1fd6 If the proposed law on acquisition of land is passed, it will be a setback to industrial, infrastructure and urbanization projects, business leaders said at the World Economic Forum's India Economic Forum on Monday.Representatives of industry criticised many provisions of the law, including its mandate on purchase price to be several times the current market rate, the provision that buyers are responsible for rehabilitation and resettlement of those displaced, including giving them a share of equity or jobs for 26 years.We believe it is not fair. If there is forcible land acquisition, it should be difficult and expensive, said <PER>5ce4cd098c5a90d8497ee551</PER>, Founder and Chairman, Hirco Group, said, adding that it was unfair that the same provisions on pricing and rehabilitation should apply when land is sold voluntarily.The Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2011, applies if more than 50 acres of urban land or 100 acres of rural land is being acquired. <PER>5ce4cd098c5a90d8497ee54f</PER>, Chairman and Managing Director, <ORG>5ce4c3578c5a90d84964f9fd</ORG>, planned its proposal that the consent of 80 per cent of those likely to be affected should be achieved before the purchase takes place, explaining that land ownership is so fragmented and titles so unclear that this provision can extend the process of land purchase indefinitely.<PER>5ce4cd098c5a90d8497ee552</PER>, Chief Secretary, Government of Maharashtra, asserted that most projects were built on marginal, unirrigated and infertile lands, and the only way to create jobs to absorb the excess rural workforce was to expand the manufacturing sector.<PER>PRASHANT BANGUR</PER>, Executive President, <ORG>SHREE CEMENT LIMITED</ORG>, said the Bill needed to inject an element of certainty and finality in land buyers' responsibilities, arguing that it is counterproductive to guarantee a job to the displaced for 26 years, as they would have no motivation to be productive.<PER>5ce4cd098c5a90d8497ee54f</PER> demanded that the land acquisition bill should be transferred from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Rural Development to the Ministry of Law. <PER>5ce4cd098c5a90d8497ee54f</PER> also argued that the onus of rehabilitation should not be on the buyer but on the government. If the bill in its present form is passed, there will be no development in the country for the next 100 years, <PER>5ce4cd098c5a90d8497ee54f</PER> said.

KUMAR RAJAGOPALAN 	 RETAILERS ASSOCIATION'S SKILL COUNCIL OF INDIA 
 593d7e967be9e018040296c8 <PER>5ce4ccfb8c5a90d8497ebeba</PER> in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI) New Delhi, Oct. 11: The government is considering raising the foreign direct investment cap of 51 per cent in single-brand retail. We are seriously considering raising the bar further, which means allowing increased FDI, commerce minister <PER>5ce4ccfb8c5a90d8497ebeba</PER> said. <PER>5ce4ccfb8c5a90d8497ebeba</PER>, however, did not say by how much the bar will be raised. Only when we take the decision, you will get to know how much it is, <PER>5ce4ccfb8c5a90d8497ebeba</PER> said. According to <PER>5ce4ccfb8c5a90d8497ebeba</PER>, the government wants to create a favourable environment for investors. You bring in FDI or partnership, surely it will be a game-changer, <PER>5ce4ccfb8c5a90d8497ebeba</PER> said. The move is seen as an important step towards opening up of the multi-brand segment to global players. At present, 51 per cent FDI is allowed in single-brand retail run by global chains such as Adidas, Nike, Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci. There are no curbs on foreign investments in wholesale cash-and-carry business. The government does not allow FDI in the lucrative multi-brand retail, which employs 33 million and is dominated by local grocers. Global retailers such as Walmart, Carrefour, Tesco and Metro AG have been seeking greater access to the fast-growing but restrictive retail sector. <PER>KUMAR RAJAGOPALAN</PER>, CEO of the <ORG>RETAILERS ASSOCIATION'S SKILL COUNCIL OF INDIA</ORG>, said, Lots of global retailers of lifestyle goods and apparel will definitely come if the FDI limit is raised. However, it is not a substitute for opening up of multi-brand retail. Allowing FDI in multi-brand retail is more crucial as it will have a lot of impact on inflation, supply chain and infrastructure, which cannot be achieved by single-brand retail, <PER>KUMAR RAJAGOPALAN</PER> said. A committee of secretaries has given a go-ahead to FDI in multi-brand retail with riders, but the government still needs to build a political consensus on the issue. Sources said the committee had set $100 million as the investment floor and at least 50 per cent of this amount had to be in back-end infrastructure such as cold storage, soil testing labs and seed farming. Jaeger-LeCoultre Swiss watch maker Jaeger-LeCoultre is set to open its retailing subsidiary  Richemont India  in the country. The firm, which has been selling watches in India through distributors, said the move was a precursor to opening its exclusive stores. Initially, stores will be opened in high-end malls in Mumbai and Delhi. India is a strong market for us and has the potential to become one of the biggest markets in Asia and West Asia. We are setting up a direct office to begin with, international director <PER>5ce4ccfb8c5a90d8497ebeb8</PER> said.

 59239dc47be9e01fd59aeca3 Mumbai is a step closer towards having its own ropeway transport, with the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the ropeway over the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) connecting Thane and Borivali almost complete. The project survey is complete and <ORG>5ce4c8da8c5a90d849738b35</ORG>, the consultants for the project, should submit the DPR by the end of May. It will be a cost-effective public transport facility and will also promote tourism, as passengers will get a birds eye view of the national park, said <PER>5ce4c8da8c5a90d849738b37</PER>, Additional Metropolitan Commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).Proposed to be a 9-km ropeway, the Rs 1,000-crore project will provide east-west connectivity between the two suburbs and drastically reduce travel time. As a mode of public transport, it is touted to be at par with the metro and can transport 4,000-5,000 people per hour in one direction. The exact location of the ropeway is yet to be finalised and the consultants are considering several options.Since it is an environmentally sensitive area, we are looking at options that will cause the least amount of damage to the environment, said an official working on the DPR.With most ropeways in the country serving tourism purposes, this ropeway might be one of the few that will help passengers commute to work.Meanwhile, the <ORG>MAHARASHTRA STATE ROAD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LIMITED</ORG> has also begun the survey for an 11-km underground tunnel that will run under the SGNP connecting Borivali and Thane. The construction of the tunnel will help motorists avoid the current 23-km drive through Ghodbunder Road, in the process decongesting the road.Speaking about the need for both the projects connecting the same places, <PER>KIRAN KURUNDKAR</PER>, Joint Managing Director, <ORG>MAHARASHTRA STATE ROAD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LIMITED</ORG>, said, With Mumbais population, whatever we plan can fall short. The two modes of transport will complement each other. The tunnel will ensure faster connectivity for vehicular traffic whereas the ropeway will be for public transport.Transport expert <PER>5ce4c87f8c5a90d8497297cc</PER> agreed that the city needs east-west connectivity. However, <PER>5ce4c87f8c5a90d8497297cc</PER> said that the government should focus on cheaper projects first.The tunnel is a good idea as it will improve east-west connectivity. With the western suburbs saturated, more residences are moving to the east. However, the focus right now should be on the Goregaon-Kanjurmarg road through Aarey rather than Borivali-Thane. Also, the ropeway has a very low capacity and has little to offer besides its tourism value, <PER>5ce4c87f8c5a90d8497297cc</PER> said.Environmentalists, too, have raised concerns, saying any development project passing through a national park is bound affect the environment. However, both the MMRDA and the <ORG>MAHARASHTRA STATE ROAD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LIMITED</ORG> claim the projects are environment-friendly.The tunnel will be 100-metre underground and will not disturb the flora and fauna in any way. The animals will not hear any vehicular sound. The tunnel begins and ends outside the national park and we have found places where there are no trees. Only some shrubs will have to be cut, said <PER>KIRAN KURUNDKAR</PER>.Environmentalist <PER>5ce4c8da8c5a90d849738b36</PER> said instead of both the projects, the government should choose the one less damaging.Between the two, the ropeway would be a more environment-friendly project. However, it also depends on how they implement it, as the construction activity itself will disturb the ecosystem. There is life underground as well, and the tunnel will ruin it. Also, it will cause damage to the water table in the area. In India, plans are often not followed.Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) reports are prepared, but more often than not they give favourable views. The suggested mitigation measures are also rarely followed, she said.benita.chacko@expressindia.comFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

VAIDHEESH ANNASWAMY 	 GLAXOSMITHKLINE PHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED 
 59355a0f7be9e061b1736e99 Mumbai: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) may not result in substantial savings for consumers on their medical bills with medicines falling under the 12% tax slab. But the pharmaceuticals industry will gain with streamlining of compliance framework, supply chain savings and operational efficiency. At present, the effective rate of taxation on drugs is 11-12%, so "the impact will be neutral", Hitesh Sharma, tax partner and leader life sciences, EY India , told TOI.With GST rates of 5% for a handful of identified life-saving drugs, and 12% for overall medicines, the announcement is on expected lines. <PER>VAIDHEESH ANNASWAMY</PER>, VP, South Asia, and MD, <ORG>GLAXOSMITHKLINE PHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED</ORG>, said, "It would not lead to increase in prices of medicines." Regarding certain life-saving drugs for different kinds of cancers, severe rheumatoid arthritis and epilepsy, imported at 0%, MNCs have sought a clarification on whether those would undergo a change in rate with GST implementation, an industry expert said.Though the government on Friday exempted healthcare services from GST, certain diagnostic and surgical equipment including operation tables, beds and dental chairs will attract a higher rate of 18%, which could inflate hospital bills for certain patients. Coronary stents , coronary stent systems for use with cardiac catheters, artificial kidney, disposable sterilised dialyser or microbarrier of artificial kidney will be taxed at the lower slab of 5%, while spectacle lenses, glucometer and test strips are under 12% slab. All types of serological and immunological testing kits (important for in-vitro diagnostic testing) have been placed in the 12% slab, while hepatitis diagnostic tests have been placed in the 5% slab.Though healthcare services have been exempted from GST, it remains to be seen whether the exemption is applicable to the entire range or just selected ones as the list of exempted services has not been published. "Prices for most medical devices will not increase for their clients (hospitals) in supply chain for those items at 12% or below. Patients will not get benefit of GST unless the MRP (on the pack) comes down," said <PER>5ce4c7168c5a90d8496eca19</PER>, forum coordinator of industry body AIMED Medical devices have been grouped under different tax slabs. G S K <PER>5ce4c36c8c5a90d849652f26</PER>, chairman & MD at Trivitron , said, "The first cut looks a bit confusing for medical devices with different devices being put in zero, 5%, 12% and 18% categories. All medical devices including implantable devices, diagnostics equipment, and all other devices should be put under the same classification of 5% or 12% to provide a level-playing field, and avoid unnecessary confusion."

 58fd866f7be9e012bf282c9f HYDERABAD: As stereotypical as it may sound, owning a superbike is one of the drooling fantasies of every man and this craving remains embedded in ones DNA until mortality jumps in to make a pitstop. Superbikes are fast becoming a phenomenon in India and the country is steadily becoming a niche market for the mean machines. This explains why Italian superbike maker MV Agusta, the manufacturers of worlds costliest regular superbikes, announced its foray into the Indian market last month.While the target group is insignificant in the country compared to the West, a growing clan of biking enthusiasts is the key driver for big names to step foot in India. Apart from <PER>5ce4c5268c5a90d84969be11</PER> and <PER>5ce4c5268c5a90d84969be12</PER> which command the lions share, newer entrants like Ducati, Benelli and Indian Motorcycles are betting big on India too.On Tuesday, Hyderabad played host to the grand launch of Indians <PER>5ce4c5268c5a90d84969be13</PER>, the economical cousin of the legendary Scout. The entry-level bike aims to woo younger riders looking for smaller, sportier, more manageable and most importantly more affordable motorcycles. Powering the Scout Sixty is the same liquid-cooled V-twin engine of Scout but with a downsized displacement of 999cc delivering a maximum power and torque output of 78hp and 88.8Nm @ 5800rpm respectively. Transmission is offered via five-speed Manual gearbox. The bike looks almost identical to the Scout and features the same styling, suspension, brakes and chassis.Speaking about the Hyderabad market for Indian, <PER>PANKAJ VASANTLAL KIKAVAT</PER>, <ORG>POLARIS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG>, said, Sixty is the seventh model of Indian and the vehicle brings down the entry level market as it is less than 1,000 CC. The city is undoubtedly one of Indias most important economic hubs. The sharp economic growth of Hyderabad has raised the aspirations of people here, who want products which could compliment their lifestyle. I am sure that the introduction of <PER>5ce4c5268c5a90d84969be13</PER> in the city will help us grow in terms of volumes in the fast-growing luxury commuter category.Adding <PER>PANKAJ VASANTLAL KIKAVAT</PER> take on the city of Nawabs, <PER>5ce4c5268c5a90d84969be15</PER>, manager, <PER>5ce4c5268c5a90d84969be10</PER>c5a90d84969be10</PER>, said, The response from Hyderabadis has been phenomenal. We already have registered three bookings for the bike. I am amazed to see the number of Hyderabadis taking up superbiking. While it is more popular in Bengaluru, in Hyderabad, super biking is becoming more of a culture from being a mere hobby.<PER>5ce4c5268c5a90d84969be13</PER> will be available in three classic Indian <PER>5ce4c5268c5a90d84969be0f</PER> colors viz.

 593cc81d7be9e00eab858610 MADURAI: Reaching out to the DMK on any matter of importance might be a taboo for the AIADMK, but with the demand for setting up of AIIMS in the district becoming an emotive issue, the party in power is mulling that very option in Madurai, at least.When Revenue Minister R B <PER>5ce4c3538c5a90d84964f126</PER> threatened that all AIADMK MLAs in the district would resign if AIIMS was not allotted to Madurai, Thiruparankundram MLA A K Bose went a step ahead and said that they would try to rope in DMK MLAs as well to resign in case the district lost out on the premier institute.Addressing media persons at T Kallupatti in the district on Saturday, Minister <PER>5ce4c3538c5a90d84964f126</PER> said that in 2014, nearly 200 acres were identified at Thoppur in Madurai for the construction of AIIMS. Even a Central team inspected the land identified in Madurai, <PER>5ce4c3538c5a90d84964f126</PER> said.While four other places were identified as prospective locations, the minister felt that Madurai deserved it the most as a premier institute in the southern part of the State would benefit the people from far-flung areas. If the Centre fails to allot the premier institute to Madurai, all AIADMK MLAs from the district would put in their papers. I was appointed a minister by the former chief minister J Jayalalithaa to serve the people. However, if the position we hold does not serve the people, then there is no reason to remain in the post.Seconding Udayakumars opinion, MLA Bose said that all the 10 MLAs in the district would resign if AIIMS was not set up in Madurai. When pointed out that there were only eight AIADMK MLAs in Madurai district, Bose said, I would also appeal the two DMK MLAs in the district also to resign.Earlier, Minister <PER>5ce4c3538c5a90d84964f126</PER> and A K Bose attended a function at T Kallupatti in the district to oversee the foundation stone laying ceremony for a new road funded by NABARD.Meanwhile, the Members of Madurai Peoples Movement for AIIMS from southern districts have decided to stage a demonstration in Chennai and may later sit on a fast in Madurai, if the Central government decides to establish the premier institute based on the biased report.Stating this, VS <PER>Manimaran.K</PER>, Coordinator of the <ORG>PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT</ORG>, said, Despite many trade unions and association requesting the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister to establish AIIMS in Madurai, it seems the state government is favouring Thanjavur for the project.<PER>Manimaran.K</PER> further added that a reply to an RTI query filed by a Tirunelveli resident revealed that state health secretary J Radhakrishnan has written a letter to <PER>5ce4cc968c5a90d8497da94a</PER>, Joint Secretary of Union Health and Family Welfare, citing Thanjavur as the favourable location for AIIMS.However, the members alleged that the analysis of the proposed five locations in the letter is biased.There are also a few errors in the report. It says Tiruchy Airport is 30 km from Sengipatti in Thanjavur, however, it is actually 37km away. Whereas the nearest railway station to Thoppur in Madurai is Tirumangalam railway station which is just 10 km away. Also they did not make a mention that Thanjavur district has a multi-speciality government medical college and hospital, which is under construction, <PER>Manimaran.K</PER> shared.In a press statement released by the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce Industry, Senior President S Rethinavelu said, The Principal Secretary of the TN Health Department missed out on the famous Thanjavur Government Medical College and Hospital that is functioning since 1960 in <PER>Manimaran.K</PER> letter.

 5923b0157be9e01fcef05125 A V Varghese, Bangalore, July 23, 2013, DHNS: 1:51 ISTThe Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) will coordinate and spearhead a campaign along with steel, road, construction and other infrastructure industries, technologists and engineers to get the Indian Industry Standards (IS) code redrawn so that millions of tonnes of unused waste blast furnace slag can be converted into a least-cost replacement for natural sand.It has been demonstrated that granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), a by-product obtained during manufacture of iron in blast furnaces in the integrated steel plants, can effectively replace river sand.Many developed countries have been successfully using GBFS as a replacement for sand in the construction industry and infrastructure projects for more than a decade now. GBFS products manufactured under suitable quality control conditions are compliant with various international standards.They do not contain materials like chlorides, organic impurities, silt, clay and other marine materials which affect the quality and durability of concrete (cement), the common product to which slag sand has been limited in its use.According to Vaman Acharya, KSPCB Chairperson, GBFS is piled up as waste on some 200-300 acres at steel plants in Karnataka.There is tremendous potential to turn it into a replacement for river sand and our initiative is to get beyond acceptance problems, he said.However, the country is still dragging its feet over making changes to the orange book that dictates what materials can be used for road and other construction projects, said S <PER>GIRISH GOVIND PUNDLIK</PER>, Vice President, GMR. If they can include slag, it will make all the difference to protecting the environment.We are willing to use GBFS, but the norms have to change. The key clause in the norms relates to the insistence on natural material for road fill and this must be changed. Central Road Research Institute and such outifts should do the necessary tests and clear the use of GBFS materials, <PER>GIRISH GOVIND PUNDLIK</PER> said.S M R Prasad, Associate Vice President, <ORG>JSW STEEL COATED PRODUCTS LIMITED</ORG>, said, We are looking for ways to help roads and construction people and are now capable of producing GBFS products according to their needs.The labs in <ORG>JSW STEEL COATED PRODUCTS LIMITED</ORG> have shown the superiority of GBFS products over natural sand and we can also help with the incorporation of appropriate norms in IS or state standards, <PER>GIRISH GOVIND PUNDLIK</PER> said.

 58feef867be9e04117d23491 The Delhi Metro Project, and the Jaipur Metro under construction, were highlighted as good examples of promoting use of natural stone in basic construction of buildings at the 4th global stone technology forum here on Friday.The use of natural stones is not only cost-effective but also more sustainable and environment-friendly, experts pointed out.Consultant architect of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Sushil Verma said that the Delhi Metro project could be considered a showcase for the effective use of stone for large public projects. We had to cover 4, 50,000 sq meters of space related to station floors, interiors and walls and natural stone was the obvious choice. It is available in abundance, requires very little maintenance and has good aesthetics, he noted.The different categories of stone used in the Delhi metro include Kota stone, granite and sandstone. The Jaipur Metro was highlighted as another project which will be a landmark in the use of natural stone.Natural stone can be used in different ways to blend in with the surroundings. For us it was an important aspect and we will use stone to create station exteriors and interiors appropriate to the surroundings, <PER>5ce4c3f18c5a90d8496682bc</PER> said.As far as the Jaipur Metro is concerned, only one station -- which would be an underground station in the walled city -- will have a heritage' look. The rest will only have subtle indicators to remind one that this is a Jaipur Metro, <PER>5ce4c3f18c5a90d8496682bc</PER> added.<PER>5ce4c3f18c5a90d8496682bc</PER> said that the Phase III of the Delhi Metro, which will pass close to the Red Fort, might also get a heritage look.DMRC, presently working on several metro projects all over the country, is on the lookout for different types of stones for use, <PER>5ce4c3f18c5a90d8496682bc</PER> revealed.Most speakers at the two day conference had a common theme running through their presentations that stones are an inexhaustible source and switching to them in construction makes a lot of economic as well as green' sense.Summing up the deliberations, R K <PER>5ce4c35f8c5a90d849650e1f</PER>, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for Development of Stones (CDOS), said that though stones were being used for lending beauty and aesthetic appeal to construction one should not forget that stones are highly versatile and can be used as a basic construction material.<PER>RAJENDRA BHANAWAT</PER>, Managing Director of Rajasthan State Industrial Development and <ORG>INVESTMENT CORPORATION (RATLAM) PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> said that an aggressive promotion of dimensional stones by CDOS had changed the general perception about natural stone, causing it to make a strong comeback.While stone has been used to lend beauty to buildings, it is also a basic construction material

Photo: D. GopalakrishnanThe Tamil Nadu Minister for Environment B.V. <PER>5ce4c3338c5a90d84964a7ef</PER> has assured the tanners in Vellore district that the government would cooperate with them in the cost-effective implementation of the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) project by the Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) for the treatment and disposal of effluents from tanneries in Vellore district.Speaking at a function got up on the premises of the CETP run by the <ORG>RANIPET TANNERY EFFLUENT TREATMENT COMPANY LIMITED</ORG>ivedu near <ORG>RANIPET TANNERY EFFLUENT TREATMENT COMPANY LIMITED</ORG>e4c3db8c5a90d849664f69</ORG> in connection with the inspection of the project by the Minister and <PER>5ce4c3338c5a90d84964a7ef</PER> team on Tuesday, <PER>5ce4c3338c5a90d84964a7ef</PER> said that an ultimate solution to the old problem of pollution of groundwater resources by tannery effluents has been found in the form of ZLD which involves the treatment of the effluents through the reverse osmosis (RO) process and reuse of 95% of the treated liquid effluents by the tanneries themselves for the industrial process by returning the treated effluents to the tanneries through pipelines.The problem now is the operation and maintenance (O & M) cost of the project, the Minister said, referring to the earlier statement made by M. Mohamed Hashim, Chairman, CEMCOT (<ORG>5ce4c3bc8c5a90d849660094</ORG> of Tanners), the Special Purpose Vehicle which is implementing the Rs.44-crore ZLD project in <ORG>RANIPET TANNERY EFFLUENT TREATMENT COMPANY LIMITED</ORG> that the O & M cost of the project is very high and that not all tanners could afford it. Mr. Hashim had requested the government to provide 60% power subsidy for the ZLD projects of leather tanneries and leather CETPs.The Minister said that the government would offer cooperation to the tanneries and the CETPs in the cost-effective implementation of the ZLD projects by all the eight CETPs in Vellore district. He advised the CETPs to go in for captive power generation plants to achieve self-sufficiency in power, and also explore the possibility of tapping solar energy for operating the ZLD project.A. <PER>5ce4c3db8c5a90d849664f6d</PER>, Minister for Backward Classes Welfare who is himself a tanner said that the ZLD project involving RO treatment would result in the reduction of exploitation of groundwater by the tanneries since the project involves the reuse of the treated water by the tanneries. Experiments revealed that the total dissolved solids (TDS) in the effluent water treated through the RO system was less than 500 parts per million (ppm).At present, the treated water from the ZLD plant was being sent to the member tanneries through tankers for reuse.The results obtained from the tanning of leather using the recovered water were very good since the usage of salt is reduced. Besides, the biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluents emanating from the industrial process using the RO-treated water is less.<PER>5ce4c3db8c5a90d849664f66</PER>, Chairman, Council for Leather Exports (CLE) said that the central government has allotted Rs.600 crores in the 12th Five-Year Plan for the establishment of mega leather clusters.Each leather cluster would get a subsidy of Rs.100 crore. A leather cluster would be started in Tamil Nadu within the next two years, <PER>5ce4c3db8c5a90d849664f66</PER> said.<PER>5ce4c3b38c5a90d84965e7d5</PER>, Managing Director, CEMCOT said that the cost of operating the ZLD plant was Rs.140 to Rs.160 per cubic meter of water recovered from the system as against the cost of Rs.30 to Rs.40 in the conventional system. Sixty percent of the cost of O & M goes towards power, <PER>5ce4c3b38c5a90d84965e7d5</PER> said, and requested the minister to arrange for concession on the power utilised by the CETPs as given to municipal sewage treatment plants.<PER>RAMESH PRASAD</PER>, Chairman, <ORG>RANIPET TANNERY EFFLUENT TREATMENT COMPANY LIMITED</ORG> said that out of the project cost of Rs.44 crore, 50% would be met by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industries, Government of India, 15% by the Tamil Nadu government and 35% by the CETPs. <PER>5ce4c3db8c5a90d849664f6f</PER>, Chairman (Southern Region), CLE spoke. <PER>5ce4c3db8c5a90d849664f64</PER>, Managing Director, RANITEC CETP proposed a vote of thanks.Earlier talking to newspersons, S. Balaji, Member Secretary, TNPCB said that while 95% of the recovered water from the CETPs under the ZLD project would be reused by the tanneries, the remaining 5% would be sent to the evaporation yard, where the salt and the water would be segregated.The residual water would be sent back to the tanneries along with the recovered water from the RO system for reuse in the manufacturing process. The salt would be stored in the yards.We have asked the CEMCOT and the CETP to come up with an alternative disposal method for the salt with the help of the Central Leather Research Institute, <PER>5ce4c3db8c5a90d849664f64</PER> said.

RISHI RAJ INANI 	 HSBC ASSET MANAGEMENT (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED 
 58fd3a8b7be9e06c93717883 CHENNAI: Retail inflation has continued to fall for the third consecutive month, standing at a 13 month low of 4.31 per cent during the month of September. The continuing deceleration has begun speculations of there being enough room for yet another rate cut from the RBI, some experts indicating that one in December might be possible.The fall in retail inflation, which stood at 5.05 per cent in August and 6.07 per cent in July, has primarily been driven by falling food prices. Food inflation has been a major source of concern for monetary policy makers, especially since they have ruled on the higher side for a while.According to data from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), growth in food prices has eased to 3.88 per cent compared to 5.91 per cent in August. However, falling food inflation is a marked change from the past few years. MOSPI data shows that food inflation averaged 8.46 per cent from 2012 until 2016, reaching an all time high of 14.72 per cent in November, 2013 and a record low of 2.15 per cent in July, 2015.The figures are likely to further support decisions pushing for a low interest regime, especially since most regions have seen a better than average monsoon. The Reserve Bank takes into account retail inflation while deciding on its key lending rate and it has been mandated to contain inflation at 4 per cent, within 2 per cent range on either side.The RBI has already cut rates by 0.25 per cent to 6.25 per cent this month and with inflation decelerating a little, it might choose to cut rates again to boost industrial growth, which has been pushed into the negative zone.The latest retail inflation print is likely to give the central bank some comfort after its latest cut and opens up a possibility of another cut in rates in December, pointed out <PER>RISHI RAJ INANI</PER>, Economist, Deloitte India.Further, stability in food prices in the coming months is likely to give credence to the fact that the momentum in food inflation has witnessed a downward shift in the near term.. the decline in inflation is on the back of a decline in vegetable prices while overall food inflation has also come down. This possibly shows that the positive effects of a good monsoon have started to flow through the economy. Further, prices of pulses have also declined, <PER>RISHI RAJ INANI</PER> added.Meanwhile, Dhiraj Sachdev, Fund Manager, <ORG>HSBC ASSET MANAGEMENT (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> said that a rate cut by December is a distinct possibility. We can expect another rate cut of 25 basis points by the end of the calendar year, and if inflation sustains in the early part of next year then we could see more rate cuts.

RAVINDERSING GURUCHARANSINGH CHOPRA 	 PIAGGIO VEHICLES PRIVATE LIMITED 
 593c91be7be9e00eb77c0985 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The five-and-half-year old Tata-Fiat distribution alliance for cars has finally collapsed. <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG>  an equal joint venture between Italys Fiat SpA and Tata Motors  has decided to stop selling its cars through Tata Motors network of dealers. Tata and <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> cars will not be sold in the same showroom anymore. We have already started the process and we will cover 20 cities in the next one and-a-half years, <PER>5ce4cc6f8c5a90d8497d3618</PER>, chief executive officer and president at <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG>, told reporters here today. We are opening two <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> cafes  one each in Delhi and Pune  to promote the brand and stress on its Italian-ness, added <PER>5ce4cc6f8c5a90d8497d3618</PER>. Under an agreement signed in December 2006, the two partners had agreed to establish a plant to produce 100,000 cars and 200,000 engines and transmission systems at a new facility at Ranjangaon near Pune. They had also agreed to expand their dealership network to 100 outlets. Relations between the two carmakers turned frosty earlier this year as the Italian carmaker felt that Tata dealers werent doing enough to push <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> models. Sales of <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> cars have been sluggish and hit a nadir in December last year when it slumped to 271 units. Last month, the Tata dealers were able to sell just 1,069 <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> cars even as customers bought 16,829 Tata cars. At the 66th annual general meeting of Tata Motors in Mumbai on August 12, <PER>5ce4cc6f8c5a90d8497d3617</PER> told shareholders that <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> had made certain assumptions about the Indian market that had gone badly awry. Those assumptions in terms of volumes did not work out  more so for <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> than for us  because there was a downturn. As we are 50 per cent owners, we had to share the losses of the company. Both <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> and we are relooking at that whole contractual undertaking to see that we can make it more realistic. I hope we will be able to resolve that in course of time, <PER>5ce4cc6f8c5a90d8497d3617</PER> said. The Tatas have invested Rs 1,199.54 crore in <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> and more than half of the value of their investment has been wiped out by the Rs 1,214 crore accumulated losses at <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> in its three years of operations. The losses in 2010-11 were pared to Rs 246 crore through an aggressive cost-cutting strategy. <PER>5ce4cc6f8c5a90d8497d3617</PER> had said the group was looking to rework the contractual relationship with Fiat SpA. A week later, <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> boss <PER>5ce4cc6f8c5a90d8497d3619</PER> said at Rimini, Italy that the car maker intended to continue the partnership with the Tatas but would be seeking to change the terms of engagement. The terms will change but the project will keep going ahead, <PER>5ce4cc6f8c5a90d8497d3619</PER> had said. <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> sells only three models in India: Palio Stile, hatchback Grande Punto and sedan Linea. <ORG>5ce4cbc68c5a90d8497b63e9</ORG> is currently developing a new small car, which is expected to be launched by the end of next year. At less than Rs 4 lakh, this model will be pitted against marques from the Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motors stables. Bike boom Mahindra & Mahindra and <ORG>PIAGGIO VEHICLES PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> want to re-enter the bike segment, encouraged by the steady growth in the two-wheeler market. While Mahindra & Mahindra plans to relaunch its Stallio motorcycle by November this year, three-wheeler manufacturer <ORG>PIAGGIO VEHICLES PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> said it would re-enter the scooter segment with the Vespa model by March next year. <ORG>PIAGGIO VEHICLES PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> is also evaluating a possible foray into the motorcycle segment. We are setting up a facility with a 1.5 lakh unit initial annual capacity to launch the Vespa, <PER>RAVINDERSING GURUCHARANSINGH CHOPRA</PER>, CMD, <ORG>PIAGGIO VEHICLES PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> said.

 593abd767be9e003363dc6a4 Video-production company <ORG>ZOOM COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED</ORG> is contemplating an appeal to the Supreme Court against United-Kingdom-based broadcaster SIS Live, after it invoked its performance guarantee. SIS Live was responsible for the broadcast coverage of the 2010 Commonwealth Games (CWG).SIS Live and <ORG>ZOOM COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED</ORG>, and the Prasar Bharati officials who negotiated their CWG contract, are being probed by the CBI after the Prime Minister-appointed <PER>5ce4cacb8c5a90d84978bd6c</PER> committee pointed out irregularities in the contract. While SIS Live's contract with Prasar Bharati was worth Rs.246 crore, it had sub-contracted work amounting to Rs.177 crore to <ORG>ZOOM COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED</ORG>. The performance guarantees were worth 10 per cent of the contract.A day earlier, Prasar Bharati had invoked its own performance guarantee in its contract with SIS Live, claiming that the British broadcaster had not fulfilled all the terms of the contract.It is unfortunate that SIS Live has invoked the performance guarantee of <ORG>ZOOM COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED</ORG> Communications. This, despite the fact that <ORG>ZOOM COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED</ORG> successfully completed all its deliverables under its sub-contract agreement and SIS Live continues to owe <ORG>ZOOM COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED</ORG> over Rs.70 crore prior to invocation, <PER>UMESH TULSHAN</PER>, Director <ORG>ZOOM COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED</ORG> said.

SOICHIRO ODA 	 HONDA CARS INDIA LIMITED 
 593ada847be9e009ad91b1be HYDERABAD: <ORG>HONDA CARS INDIA LIMITED</ORG> today said India is not yet ready to have electric cars in large numbers due to the lack of necessary infrastructure and affordability factor.<PER>SOICHIRO ODA</PER>, President and CEO of <ORG>HONDA CARS INDIA LIMITED</ORG> said here that <PER>SOICHIRO ODA</PER> company is developing electric cars but to anticipate a significant number of such cars plying on Indian roads is little early, chiefly because of infrastructure and affordability reasons."Honda is developing electric cars. However, we believe it is too early for India to talk about electric vehicles. One thing is infrastructure. And secondly the car price will be more than double (when compared to ordinary car)," <PER>SOICHIRO ODA</PER> told reporters in a press conference."Indian is so price sensitive. So it looks difficult (for electric cars) and also the development of infrastructure in a country as large as India will take a lot of time," <PER>SOICHIRO ODA</PER> said.The statement assumes significance in the wake of recent announcement made by Union Power Minister <PER>5ce4c4858c5a90d849680cda</PER> that the country is looking at having an all-electric car fleet by 2030 with an express objective of lowering the fuel import bill and running cost of vehicles.The automobile major recently reportedly announced that two third of its global sales will come from electric vehicles.Honda sold nearly 1.6 lakh vehicles last year and is looking to grow over 8 per cent this year."The automobile industry is expected to grow at 7 to 8 per cent. We also expect to grow at the same rate on the back of new launches such as New City and WR-V," <PER>SOICHIRO ODA</PER> said.To a query, <PER>SOICHIRO ODA</PER> said the company which is currently viewed as a premium brand, is mulling over whether to changeover as a 'mass brand'.The Japanese car maker said it has received over 30,000 bookings for its 'Honda City' since its launch this year in mid-February, and 16,000 for Honda WR-V since mid-March.Honda has so far invested over Rs 8,000 crore in its Indian operations and is making profits.It has two manufacturing facilities each at Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh, and Tapukara in Rajasthan with a combined capacity of nearly 2.4 lakh units per annum

BRAHMOD KUMAR BHUTIANI 	 COAL CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION OF INDIA 
 593ac8e07be9e001d89d6301 Piqued at the differential rate hike effected by Coal India Ltd (CIL), the <ORG>COAL CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION OF INDIA</ORG> is planning to knock on the door of the (Prime Minister's Office) PMO seeking that a committee be set up to examine the entire issue.At a joint press conference addressed, among others by a former CIL Chairman <PER>BRAHMOD KUMAR BHUTIANI</PER>, the <ORG>COAL CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION OF INDIA</ORG> said that there was need for appointing a coal regulator to check such arbitrary price increases.<PER>BRAHMOD KUMAR BHUTIANI</PER> now heads a mining consultancy outfit and is also on the boards of various listed and unlisted companies.On February 28, CIL announced a three-tiered increase in prices under which spared sectors like power-utilities and IPPs (independent power producers) and the fertilizer sector from a 30 per cent increase in prices which was effective for all other sectors, including steel and cement which had market- driven prices. Prices were also increased for coal produced by Mahanadi Coalfields as also that of the superior A and B grades.<PER>5ce4cb4c8c5a90d8497a1220</PER>, chief financial officer of <ORG>5ce4c4c98c5a90d84968bd40</ORG>, a major cement producer, said that the burden of 70 per cent of the consumers, that is, the power utilities, was being thrust on the remaining 30 per cent who will now have to suffer a hefty increase in their cost of production. <PER>5ce4cb4c8c5a90d8497a1220</PER> said that for cement companies, coal costs, which were around 20 per cent of the total production cost, had increased by 40 per cent.B. Bhushan Agarwal of Shyam Steel said that the sector's coal cost had increased by around 20 per cent as it had for the paper sector.<PER>BRAHMOD KUMAR BHUTIANI</PER> said that CIL might have had a good justification in increasing the price of coal, but such serious discrimination between the sectors was basically wrong.Had it increased at the rate of 10 per cent across sectors, there would have been no debate, but in this case some grades, that is, A and B, have seen a 150 per cent increase. This also marks a break with the past practice of effecting a hike of around 4 per cent.U. Bhattacharyya , representing CESC, said that the company was affected by the increase in A and B grades as it used these higher grades at its older plants where coal was historically sourced from Eastern Coalfields due to its proximity. A paper manufacturer from Gujarat, however, said that <PER>BRAHMOD KUMAR BHUTIANI</PER> too used the superior A and B .

 58fed7a67be9e0413615ff5b New Delhi, May 4, 2016 (PTI) 17:01 ISTWidening its probe in the Rs 3,600 crore VVIP chopper deal, the ED has begun a trail of "cash" which is suspected to have been paid as alleged kickbacks for the purchase of 12 helicopters from UK-based AgustaWestland.The financial probe agency has set the ball rolling with the second round of questioning of witnesses and accused in connection with the scam and is likely to quiz former IAF Chief S P Tyagi tomorrow, provided his recording of statement with the CBI ends today.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has been probing the money laundering angle in the case, has summoned cousins of <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER> after <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER> round of questioning is over besides realty firm <ORG>EMAAR MGF LAND LIMITED</ORG>'s boss <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd3</PER>'s name cropped up after it was found that the alleged middleman <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd2</PER> was an independent director of the firm between September to December 2009.Company officials said <PER>5ce4c3318c5a90d84964a1f8</PER> will cooperate with investgative agencies. The ED, in its charge sheet filed last year in a court, had claimed to have detected flow of alleged kickbacks sent from abroad to companies of the accused <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd5</PER> and cousin brothers of the former IAF chief.Officials said the flow of funds is being probed as it is alleged that it was quid pro quo to make AgustaWestland eligible to get selected for the final delivery of the 12 AW-101 helicopters to India for VVIP flying duties.The ED, as per the charge sheet, had traced two payments of Euro 1,26,000 and another two lakh Euros from a company based in Tunisia and others made to <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER> brothers "camouflaged" in the form of consultancy fee and its probe had found that the said "remittances correspond with the developments taking place in alteration/reduction of mandatory servicing ceiling of the helicopters."The ED claimed that "besides these two remittances, the Tyagi brothers including the then IAF Chief <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER>, also received some amount of cash from <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd2</PER> and <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd1</PER>."The ED probe found that the alleged middlemen <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd2</PER> and <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd1</PER>, in collusion with the Tyagi brothers <PER>5ce4c3018c5a90d84964353f</PER>, <PER>5ce4c50f8c5a90d849697a73</PER> and <PER>5ce4c35c8c5a90d849650722</PER> "managed to make inroads in IAF through Air Chief Marshal <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER> and thereby could influence and subvert the consistent stand of IAF regarding mandatory service ceiling of the helicopters."This ground was used by CBI and ED to register their respective FIRs in the case and brought out the alleged illegal involvement of the ex-IAF chief and <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER> cousins in perpetrating the scam.The agency, sources said, suspects the tainted cash could have been used by the accused for making certain high-value payments and purchase of costly items.It is also expected that a joint team of the two agencies could be authorised by the government to soon travel to few overseas locations to track the trail of funds, both through wire tranfer and cash.Sources said while the agency has filed its first charge sheet in the case last year in November, it is now looking to establish the further "proceeds of crime" of the alleged scam in order to prepare a water tight case against other accused and even those named earlier in its prosecution complaint."That includes both cash and wire transfer funds routed through multiple or single overseas locations," they said.It has recently begun a second round of questioning of the accused in the wake of the recent judgement of a Milan (Italy) based court which sentenced Italian defence and aerospace major Finmeccanica's former chief <PER>5ce4c3448c5a90d84964d0ac</PER> and the former CEO of the firm Bruno Spagnolini on corruption charges in the sale of a dozen AgustaWestland helicopters to India.The Milan court order also mentions the name of <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER> at several points. ED will also go through the contents of the order as soon as it gets translated into English from Italian, they said, adding there could be few more attachments of the accused in the case after the agency detected some more 'benami' properties.Apart from filing a charge sheet, the ED has also attached assets worth Rs 11 crore belonging to the cousins of <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER> and Italian national and another alleged middleman in the case <PER>5ce4c4d78c5a90d84968e72d</PER>.All the three middlemen have been notified by the two agencies under the Red Corner Notice of the Interpol also early this year.While <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER> has denied all the allegations against <PER>Harish Tyagi</PER>, <ORG>EMAAR MGF LAND LIMITED</ORG> has said it has no "business links" with <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd0</PER>'s aide <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd6</PER> while <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd2</PER> was an independent director for an "extremely brief period".As BJP MP <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd4</PER> dragged <PER>5ce4c5d08c5a90d8496b7fd6</PER>'s name into the controversy involving alleged kickbacks paid for the VVIP chopper deal, <ORG>EMAAR MGF LAND LIMITED</ORG> termed the allegations as "baseless and incorrect."

While announcing the decision to lift the ban, an Air India spokesperson had said the move followed a written order from the civil aviation ministry.Full service carrier Vistara today said it supports the decision of industry peers. "We stood in solidarity with Air India and members of the <ORG>5ce4c3748c5a90d849654828</ORG> during this recent episode... We continue to stand by them today in their decision to revoke the ban," a spokesperson said in a statement.Noting that unruly and disruptive passengers are a serious safety and security threat, the airline said, "we are hopeful this incident results in specific regulations and actions to address this important issue".No-frills airline <ORG>AIRASIA (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED</ORG> today said it does not tolerate abusive or unruly behaviour by passengers that puts the safety of other guests and crew members on board at risk."We will support the decision taken by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the industry with regard to the recent incident involving an Air India staff," an airline spokesperson said in a statement.

 5928ef127be9e0137c781aa5 Railway budget pleases YeddyurappaLast updated: 25 February, 2011Bangalore, Feb 25, DHNS: 22:30 ISTChief Minister B S Yeddyurappa has expressed satisfaction over announcements for the state in the railway budget presented by Mamata Banerjee. But he is disappointed over delay in implementing the projects announced in the past.Speaking to reporters in Bangalore on Friday, Yeddyurappa said the railway minister had announced 11 new trains and extended four existing routes. A railway coach unit will come up in Kolar and a railway training centre has been allotted for Dharwad. The minister has also sanctioned electrification of Bangalore-Hubli railway line.The State Government has assured to share 50 per cent of cost in all projects announced for the state. As much as Rs 487 crore would be released for the purpose in next three years. The Centre should give more importance to Karnataka in implementing the projects at the earliest, he said. He said soon he would take a delegation of MPs of Karnataka to meet the Railway minister and press her to complete the projects announced in the past.<PER>5ce4c4798c5a90d84967f1b9</PER> of Praja, a voluntary organisations engaged in civic activities, has stated that there is no major projects or Superfast trains sanctioned. When there was huge demand from the State Government to take up the Commuter Rail for Bangalore and its suburbs on 50:50 cost sharing basis, the Railway Minister has not considered the proposal and Bangalore once again neglected on this.N S <PER>SRINIVASAN KRISHNAMOORTHY</PER>, President of <ORG>FEDERATION OF INDIA-ARAB CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY</ORG> has said that while in several states in the country the average kilometres of railway line is 65 km per 1,000 sq kms, but in Karnataka it is only 16 kms during the 12th plan. Unless and until more railway lines and more number of trains run, the place will not see the improvement that is needed, <PER>SRINIVASAN KRISHNAMOORTHY</PER> added.Prakash Mandoth, Ex-member of Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee criticised the railway budget as Mamtas election budget and K H Muniyappas Kolar budget. Many of the trains given to Karnataka are not independent trains, but those which pass through the state. Despite so much demand, there is no mention of commuter train for Bangalore.

RAJIV KUMAR GUPTA 	 FEDERATION OF INDIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. 
 593c047e7be9e0512ed033f1 New Delhi, March 14: Japanese investors may hold back investments in India following the earthquake and the tsunami  but this will only be for a short period. The huge opportunities in infrastructure along with New Delhis assurances on easy FDI rules should make the country an attractive destination for Japanese firms in the long term. Tokyo, the sixth largest investor in the country, brought in $1.19 billion in April-December this fiscal, out of a total $16 billion of inflows into the nation, according to latest government data. Japanese inflow into the country was $405 million in 2008-09. Indias exports to Japan will decline because of the economic upheaval. Second, the higher FDI inflows we were expecting from Japan will be diverted into rebuilding their own economy, <PER>RAJIV KUMAR GUPTA</PER>, director-general of the <ORG>FEDERATION OF INDIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY.</ORG>, said. However, a senior commerce ministry official said, The tragic developments in Japan will not have any impact on Indias bilateral trade there could be some delay in short-term inflows FDI decisions are taken with a long-term view and Indias growth story is attractive enough for Japanese investors to continue looking at it. India is second in global foreign direct investments in 2010 and will continue to remain among the top five nations during 2010-12, according to Unctads World Investment Prospects Survey 2009-2012. Japanese investors in a survey by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation prior to the calamity ranked India as the second most promising country for overseas business operations. Finance minister <PER>5ce4cc0c8c5a90d8497c2633</PER> has said the government was planning to further liberalise the FDI norms to meet the ambitious $1-trillion funds requirement in the next five years for infrastructure. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo) said exports to Japan would be hit at least in the short-run, though reconstruction activities in the affected cities might lead to an increased demand for Indian steel. In the short term, delivery of goods in transit will be affected...it would also have impact on exporters payments, Fieo president <PER>5ce4caea8c5a90d849790d99</PER> said.

I think, that was the highlight this season as far as winning the championship was concerned," <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb8</PER> said.On <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb8</PER> performance in the Malaysian Rally, <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb8</PER> attributed <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb8</PER> success to mature driving that saw <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb8</PER> dominate the first day before easing off today as the terrain turned slushy and slippery following heavy overnight rains."Just five minutes before I left the Service Park for the Special Stages today, I asked the team to slap on full wet tyres instead of the half-cut rubber the car was fitted with. It was a gut feeling and it proved to the correct choice as the conditions were pretty tough because of overnight rains. I knew that <PER>5ce4c5478c5a90d8496a1241</PER> was pushing hard, but I drove pretty conservatively since I had huge overnight lead," <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb8</PER> said.Provisional classifications (After Leg-1):Asia Pacific Rally Championship: 1. <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb8</PER> / <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbbb</PER> (Team <ORG>MRF LIMITED</ORG>) (02hours, 48mins, 22.5secs); 2. <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973b97f</PER> / <PER>5ce4c4d58c5a90d84968e188</PER> (Cusco Racing) (03:19:58.2); 3. <PER>5ce4c5478c5a90d8496a1241</PER> / <PER>5ce4c5478c5a90d8496a1245</PER> (Team <ORG>MRF LIMITED</ORG>) (05:47:45.3).Asia Cup: 1. <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb8</PER> / <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbbb</PER> (02:48.22.5); 2. <PER>5ce4c5278c5a90d84969c12e</PER> / <PER>5ce4c5478c5a90d8496a123f</PER> (Cusco Racing) (03:06:23.8); 3. <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973b97f</PER> / <PER>5ce4c4d58c5a90d84968e188</PER> (03:19:58.2).Overall: 1. <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb8</PER> / <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbbb</PER> (02:48.22.5); 2. <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbb9</PER> / <PER>5ce4c8eb8c5a90d84973bbba</PER> (02:57:32.7); 3. <PER>5ce4c5278c5a90d84969c12e</PER> / <PER>5ce4c5478c5a90d8496a123f</PER> (03:06:23.8).
