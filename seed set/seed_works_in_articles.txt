That, it should be said, is a year well spent because it is not easy to get your arms around a conglomerate as unwieldy and complex as the Tatas.

There are still a couple of positions that are open, for finance and M&A.Tough movesThree clear instances prove Mr. Mistrys capability to take tough, painful decisions when necessary. The biggest of the three, of course, was the decision to drop the $1.8-billion bid by Indian Hotels for <ORG>598994719855b71f8475db9c</ORG>.The purchase of a 10.1 per cent stake in Orient-Express in 2007 by Indian Hotels and the subsequent bid to acquire the whole equity in 2012 were born out of the personal desire of Mr. Ratan Tata to own an iconic hospitality brand; to withdraw the bid was indeed a significant move. Yet, it was also a pragmatic one. Though this resulted in a charge of Rs.370 crore in Indian Hotels balance sheet, it lifted a huge burden on the company, which was not performing very well in its business anyway.Indian Hotels reported a loss of Rs.433 crore in the second quarter ended September 2013 that includes the write-off.The second bold decision was to take a Rs.2,460-crore asset impairment charge on Tata Powers balance-sheet for 2012-13 due to higher-than-planned coal import prices; this plunged the company into a Rs.1,087 crore loss. Yet again, it was a prudent decision that can be held out as an example of best practice for companies.The third example was the $1.6-billion goodwill write-off in Tata Steels balance sheet for 2012-13. The $13-billion <ORG>5982d2419855b7221e19b854</ORG> acquisition has shrunk in value due to the economic crisis in Europe and falling steel prices, and, therefore, a write-down was warranted. Of course, there are those who believe that the write-off is too little but yet it must be acknowledged that accepting a mistake and taking a penalty for that is not easy.Not intimidated by turbulenceIf success in business is all about taking a long-term view and backing yourself through the short-term problems, then Mr. Mistry demonstrated that by setting foot into two highly controversial sectors  airlines and multi-brand retail.The joint ventures with Air Asia for a budget airline and with <ORG>5982d1169855b7221e18c073</ORG> for a full-service carrier come at a time when the industry is in turbulence and airline companies are bleeding. Mr. Mistry is clearly playing for the long haul, and hoping to ride out the short-term with the power of the respective brands and the expertise that they bring to the table.The joint venture with <ORG>598994719855b71f8475db99</ORG> for multi-brand retail is similar with the added dimension of regulatory uncertainty.The group already has a retail business in Trent but the one planned with Tesco is likely to be qualitatively different. While the promise of business is indeed there given the growing middle-class, urbanisation and the advent of consumer culture, the joint venture has to push past regulatory hurdles. And, it has to do it state-by-state across India.The groups decision to pull out its application for a banking licence from the RBI was a pragmatic one. Here was a tremendous business opportunity for the conglomerate but yet it opted out once it became clear that a licence will be a shackle on the financing arms of some of its other companies and certainly on <ORG>598994719855b71f8475dba6</ORG>, its <ORG>598994719855b71f8475db90</ORG>.Consolidation phaseIf the first year was all about understanding the group, the second one is likely to be one of consolidation for Mr. Mistry. The telecom business is not going anywhere, and it should not be a surprise if a decision is made to exit it. The one bad story of the Ratan Tata-era was the mess-up of the telecom business, and Mr. Mistry will surely be trying to correct it.If his New Year message is any indication, Mr. Mistry is also likely to push for exploiting synergies across group companies. He has also clearly signified his intent to invest in innovation and R&D, which augurs well for the conglomerate.The steel and power businesses need to be steadied while the hotels business needs support.The best thing that can happen for Mr. Mistry will be resurgence in the economy which will lift most of the groups businesses. But that is unlikely to happen before the end of 2014 which means that much of his time and energy will be consumed in managing the present. Moves aimed at the future will have to wait. But then, whats the hurry anyway when he has all the time to lead the group into the next level?raghuvir.s@thehindu.co.in

: In their own words, it was a dream come true for the five young entrepreneurs with their companies incubated at the Startup Village in Kalamassery to tour the cradle of information technology, the Silicon Valley, in December last year under a programme sponsored by the <ORG>5982d0659855b7221e182d87</ORG>.The exciting trip exposed them to the myriad dimensions of the celebrated IT ecosystem in California which they said, at a media conference on Thursday, offered them better awareness on company-building than years of education and reading up had. They said the visit boosted their confidence in their ideas and opened the doors for the second round of funding of their startup initiatives. Young entrepreneur <PER>598996539855b71f847748c5</PER>, founder of <ORG>598996539855b71f847748bd</ORG>, was surprised to see his dream company <ORG>598996539855b71f847748c0</ORG> operating from a space crammed with a bench and four chairs.

The <ORG>5982d06e9855b7221e183508</ORG> (FDA) has banned the import of products from <ORG>598996499855b71f847740ec</ORG> plant in <STA>5982d0659855b7221e182d26</STA> [the companys fourth unit] due to manufacturing violation, a move that will halt shipment of all products of the pharmaceutical company to the U.S.Reacting to the development, the companys scrip tumbled 19.33 per cent to Rs.336.50 from its previous close on the BSE on Friday.In its order issued on Thursday, the FDA prohibited <ORG>5982d1b39855b7221e193e86</ORG> from producing and distributing drugs from its Toansa facility in Punjab.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today [Friday] notified Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. that it is prohibited from manufacturing and distributing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from its facility in <LOC>598995699855b71f847699c5</LOC>, India, for FDA-regulated drug products, it said in a statement available on the regulators website.The FDA ban on Ranbaxys Toansa plant followed an inspection completed on January 11, which identified significant CGMP (current good manufacturing practice) violations.The questions about Ranbaxys Toansa facilities come in the wake of the firm pleading guilty to seven criminal charges relating to fraud last May, and coughing up $500 million in fines. To date the FDA has restricted imports from three other Ranbaxy facilities in India, including Paonta Sahib, Dewas and Mohali.The agency said the Toansa facility was now subject to certain terms of a consent decree of permanent injunction entered against Ranbaxy in January, 2012.Under the decree, the FDA has issued an order prohibiting Ranbaxy from distributing in the U.S. drugs manufactured using API from Toansa, including drugs made by Ranbaxys Ohm Laboratories facility in <STA>5982d2a09855b7221e1a071a</STA>, it said.The U.S. regulator had previously barred products from the companys facilities in Paonta Sahib, Dewas and Mohali in India as part of a 2012 consent decree.We are taking swift action to prevent substandard quality products from reaching U.S. consumers, said <PER>5989965c9855b71f84774e2c</PER>, acting director of the <ORG>5989965d9855b71f84774e2d</ORG> in the <ORG>5989965c9855b71f84774e2b</ORG> and Research.Ranbaxy said it was disappointed with the FDAs action and it had voluntarily suspended shipments of products from the Toansa facility to the U.S. market when it received the inspection findings.In a statement, Ranbaxy Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director <PER>5989965c9855b71f84774e29</PER> said, This development is clearly unacceptable and an appropriate management action will be taken upon completion of the internal investigation.Further, the company said it would like to apologise to all its stakeholders for the inconvenience caused by the suspension, adding that Ranbaxy would co-operate with the USFDA and comply with the consent decree in both letter and spirit.
The U.S. health regulator plans to conduct workshops across India in the next one year to sanitise Indian drug companies about the changing quality requirements in the American market.The matter came up during a meeting between chief executives of drug companies and <ORG>5982d06e9855b7221e183508</ORG> (USFDA) Commissioner <PER>5982d1429855b7221e18e31b</PER>.<ORG>5982d2989855b7221e1a005e</ORG> Chairman <PER>598997849855b71f8478634c</PER> said the plan to conduct workshops in India was part of the USFDAs strategy to let Indian companies be more aware of the changes happening in the U.S. in terms of the requirement for quality.One of their (USFDA) objectives is to sensitise here in India about these changes. In fact, the USFDA is planning a workshop over the next one year at 3-4 locations to clarify what are the new requirements and what are the expectations of the USFDA, Mr. Khorakiwala told reporters here.During the meeting, which was attended by chiefs of pharma companies, including <ORG>5982d1b39855b7221e193e86</ORG> Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director <PER>5989965c9855b71f84774e29</PER>, <ORG>5982d1209855b7221e18c705</ORG> Founder and Managing Director <PER>598997849855b71f8478634d</PER> and Mr. Khorakiwala, the Indian delegation asked the U.S. regulator team to continue with the high-level interactions.

The <ORG>5982d0659855b7221e182d87</ORG> on Friday launched a new housing scheme by giving aid to widowed and divorced women of minority religions.Inaugurating the first instalment of the housing aid distribution at a function held at the Collectorate here, Minister for Urban Affairs and Welfare of Minorities <PER>5989946a9855b71f8475d5f7</PER> said that more beneficiaries would be included in the scheme soon.The government is providing Rs. 2 lakh each to 250 minority widows and divorcees across the State.Fifty-four of them are from <STA>5982d0c09855b7221e187a22</STA>.The Minister said that the scheme would be expanded to cover more beneficiaries.Mentioning a series of projects being implemented by the <ORG>5989953c9855b71f84767796</ORG>, Mr. Ali said that the State government was trying hard to change the notion harboured by the people of Malabar that government jobs were unreachable for them.Providing house and drinking water alone will not help to uplift the minorities.

A 24-year-old postgraduate student of social work died around midnight on Thursday in Vellore, three months after he was bitten by a pup at <MISC>5989954d9855b71f847684bc</MISC>684bc</ORG> in East Tambaram.<PER>598998349855b71f84790aa9</PER> was petting a couple of pups that had strayed into the campus in the second week of November when one of them bit him. A classmate accompanying him was also bitten.Both students were taken to the medical centre on the campus and administered tetanus shots. Alans classmate subsequently underwent a complete anti-rabies vaccination course, while Alan did not, authorities told The Hindu.On Wednesday, Alan developed high fever and began displaying symptoms of hydrophobia. He was taken to a private hospital in the city and then to <ORG>5982d07e9855b7221e1841b0</ORG>rom there, he was shifted to the <ORG>5982d15a9855b7221e18f5df</ORG> of <ORG>5982d1839855b7221e19146e</ORG>9146e</MISC> in Vellore.He failed to respond to treatment and died around midnight, <PER>598995029855b71f84764b1e</PER>, his father, said.

He loved pets, especially the Labrador they had at home, said <PER>598998349855b71f84790aaf</PER>, his aunt. The family had given away the dog last year after his mother <PER>598998349855b71f84790aaa</PER> fell while taking the Labrador for a walkAlan, an engineering graduate, worked in the software industry for two years but his heart was set on social work and he joined the college in 2013, his friends said.It is really shocking. This is the first such incident in the college and we will take steps to put an end to this problem, said principal <PER>598998349855b71f84790aab</PER>. He said that walls had been built around most of the college compound, except for a small stretch and noted that dogs were a threat to the deer on campus too.The college is spread over more than 360 acres and large parts are covered with thick vegetation. Attempts made with the cooperation of the Tambaram Municipality to trap stray dogs are not always successful as they hide amidst the vegetation, faculty said.With an increase in the number of complaints related to stray dogs from residents, the municipality is looking to expand its animal birth control project.To identify sterilised dogs, a small cut is made on the ear after surgery.The dogs are vaccinated for rabies and are released after their surgical wounds are healed, staff said.A senior official of the <ORG>598994ba9855b71f847613ac</ORG> said, We have to follow certain rules in handling stray dogs and abide by guidelines as laid down by <ORG>5982d0c29855b7221e187bae</ORG> of India.Animal rights activists noted that while precautionary measures were necessary, there should be no large-scale culling of dogs.

In a landmark transaction for the Indian pharmaceutical industry, <ORG>5982d1209855b7221e18c705</ORG> on Monday announced that it would acquire 100 per cent of <ORG>5982d1b39855b7221e193e86</ORG> in a $4 billion all-share transaction.The transaction has a total equity value of $3.2 billion and a net debt of $800 million on Ranbaxys books will also be part of the transaction.The combined entity will create the fifth-largest specialty generics company in the world and the largest pharmaceutical company in India with leadership in 13 specialty segments.The combine will have operations in 65 countries, 47 manufacturing facilities across five continents and a swathe of specialty and generics products, including 629 ANDAs (Abbreviated new drug applications). It will also become the largest Indian pharma company in the U.S. with over $2 billion sales and a pipeline of 184 ANDAs.Both companies said that they had entered into definitive agreements under which Ranbaxy shareholders will receive 0.8 shares of <ORG>5982d1209855b7221e18c705</ORG> for every share of Ranbaxy. The exchange ratio represents a value of Rs.457 per share of Ranbaxy which is at an 18 per cent premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average share price and a premium of 24.3 per cent to Ranbaxys 60-day volume-weighted average share price as on April 4, 2014. The transaction is expected to close by December 2014 and will be EPS-accretive a year after.It is a very synergistic transaction, <PER>598997849855b71f8478634d</PER>, Managing Director of Sun Pharma said in a conference call. It strengthens our presence in chronic therapy, acute care and OTC (over-the-counter) segment, all important segments going forward. The U.S. has been the largest market for Sun and this deal will further strengthen our presence there.The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and <ORG>5989951a9855b71f84765d83</ORG> which holds 63.4 per cent in Ranbaxy.<PER>5989965c9855b71f84774e29</PER>, Managing Director & CEO, Ranbaxy, said, both companies share similar ambitions to grow globally with complementary strengths. It is a landmark transaction not only for Sun but on the Indian pharma map. I foresee huge opportunities opening for all stakeholders with the coming together of the companies.On a pro forma basis, the combined entitys revenues are estimated at $4.2 billion with operating profit of $1.2 billion for calendar 2013. According to Mr. Shanghvi, although Ranbaxy has been facing regulatory compliance issues with the U.S. <ORG>5982d0949855b7221e185445</ORG>, its India and emerging markets business is robust with a pipeline for growth and profitability. We believe the valuation is justified and are confident of creating future value for the shareholders.He said both companies would use their current infrastructure to sell each others products. The synergy benefits from the transaction will be around $250 million three years after its completion. A large part of this will be derived from growth, procurement and supply chain efficiencies, Mr. Shanghvi said. Daiichi will then become the second largest shareholder in Sun and will have an independent director on <ORG>598999c19855b71f847a7bf0</ORG>.The markets to immediately leverage are India, the U.S. and then the emerging markets. Sun has sales of more than $100 million in South Africa, Russia and Romania and is looking to further strengthen our position in Brazil and Malaysia, Mr. Shanghvi said.After opening the day at Rs.505, in afternoon trade, Ranbaxy shares slid 4.84 per cent to Rs.437.3 while Sun Pharma shares rose 1.21 per cent at Rs.578.8 on the BSE on Monday.

A <ORG>5982d0749855b7221e1839d6</ORG> dealer in Jagatpuri in Delhi saw just three or four customers making purchases a day after the big announcement, paying by cheque; in happier times, 80% of his purchases were in cash. About 10 km away, in upscale Khanna Market, <PER>5982d1019855b7221e18b01b</PER>, promoter of RK Vision, a consumer electronics store, sold goods worth Rs 31 lakh until midnight, doubling his daily sales.Otherwise fussy customers bought air purifiers, refrigerators and LED televisions in a tearing hurry to dispose of their cash. After that storm, a lull quickly descended on Wednesday, with barely 15 bills raised, compared with over 100 on a normal business day.As businessmen, heavily reliant on cash, fretted about their wildly swinging fortunes, most people on the street spent much of Thursday and Friday standing in queues trying to get their hands on these new notes or figuring out how to manage with the limited, legal currency at their disposal. <PER>5982d0e89855b7221e189c33</PER>, a painter in suburban Mumbai, spent three hours on Thursday evening and a couple more on Friday before being able to finally withdraw money to pay his dues.For all of Wednesday, Kumar managed with Rs 60, before empty pockets compelled him to queue up. "This is a disservice to the poor who have to waste hours during a work day hunting for money," Kumar says.This pain is amplified away from big cities. In the small town called Ezhukone in Kerala, about 20 km from Kollam, <PER>5982d0de9855b7221e18944d</PER>, a 59-year old retired employee, uses cash to pay for her daily milk, vegetables and fish. Following the sudden demonetisation, she was left with Rs 259, with which she had to manage all her immediate purchases, with neither her neighbourhood grocer nor the pharmacist wired to accept cards or digital payments. To make ends meet, she pleaded with an auto driver to ferry her to and from the chemist to buy medicines she and her husband urgently required.She held on to her last few tenners and a desperate hope that the ATM-less Wednesday would pass without incident or emergency.If Radhakrishnan spent her time wondering how to manage with little cash, <PER>5982d0939855b7221e185397</PER> (name changed), in his cramped office in the Mumbai suburb of Andheri, is wondering how to dispose of the cash he has hoarded. An agent for the local road transport office, he keeps up to Rs 5 lakh in a locked cupboard in office and more at home. He has managed to buy some jewellery and electronics goods, but faces tough choices ahead. With fixed deposits over Rs 2.5 lakh facing tough scrutiny, that's another avenue shut, for now.Away from the chaos of managing too much or too little cash, experts divided on the efficacy of the long-term game out black money and counterfeiting of high-value notes. "It will tackle black money, corruption, terror money and counterfeiting  multiple with one stone," <PER>5982d0e09855b7221e1895d5</PER>, chairman of financial services company. "I call it gutsy because it's a move that any political party will know will be difficult and there will be plenty of reasons not to implement."<PER>5982d1019855b7221e18b016</PER> with <ORG>5982d1019855b7221e18b01c</ORG>, a management consultancy, calls this a great one time action to cleanse the system. While this is a great first move, the <ORG>5982d0659855b7221e182d78</ORG> needs to do much more to back this up. "Thus requires several follow-ups, especially tightening and better enforcement of PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) and deterrence in the form of far stricter punishment to be effective."A clampdown on black money may be meaningless with this one-off move. While this may serve as a strong notice of intent, the government faces a series of difficult choices ahead, targeting large sectors such as real estate, which are flush with these funds. "It is important to ensure the chain of black money doesn't return," says <PER>5982d1019855b7221e18b024</PER>, partner, <ORG>5982d06b9855b7221e1832b0</ORG>, a management consultancy. In the longer term, to achieve this, the government needs to build on a range of initiatives, including GST, access to bank accounts with initiatives such as <PER>5982d0659855b7221e182d95</PER> and technology enablers such as Aadhaar , to make a fist of its fight against black money.If the demonetisation has been a bigbang announcement with some immediate repercussions, it may take more gumption in the long term to strike a body blow in the fight against black money and indeed counterfeit currency. This is because a large chunk of this illicit money is squirrelled away in the form of real estate and jewellery or even overseas, away from the prying eyes of regulators. "People with malicious intent usually catch up with these changes and are quickly go one step ahead," says <PER>5982d1019855b7221e18b026</PER>, managing director, <ORG>5982d1019855b7221e18b021</ORG> , a forensics specialist."As India moves more towards a 'white' economy,' liquidating holdings overseas and stamping out counterfeiting, which thrived on operating in a cash-rich economy, must be key long-term goals."(Additional reporting by Malini Goyal)
INDORE : Cancellation of legal tender status of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 has adversely hit the textile and garment industry.Unable to procure raw materials and pay contract workers , several textile units have slashed production by 20 - 30 per cent. Hit hard by the cash crunch, many units in the region have laid off contract workers.According to experts of the total working staff, about 20-30 per cent of the workers involved in non-perennial jobs are on contract.In the series of demonetisation , unorganized or daily wage workers are the most hit as majority of them are migrant workers and do not have bank accounts to receive direct payment through banking channel.<ORG>5982d11f9855b7221e18c652</ORG>'s managing director and chairman Madhya Pradesh Textile Mills Association Piyush Mutha said, "Demonetisation has led to severe shortage of funds for regular operations in the textile industry hitting day to day business operations."Industrialists said that scrapping of large currency notes has hit the purchase of raw material, sale of finished goods and other routine factory expenses and small machinery items.Industry participants said that the availability of raw material for textile mills - cotton has reduced as farmers are brining less produce in the market due to cash crunch. They said merchants do not have cash to give to farmers who do not accept cheques.The association secretary M C Rawat said, "The main worry is how to dispense payment to workers next month. Most of them do not have bank accounts. <ORG>5982d11f9855b7221e18c656</ORG> is a cash intensive industry where cash is required for running daily activities."Market experts said that sales of garments have also reduced sharply due to cash crunch as customers are avoiding purchase.Maharaja <ORG>5982d11f9855b7221e18c653</ORG> president <PER>5982d11f9855b7221e18c655</PER> said, "Sales have gone down drastically as purchasing power of consumers have declined. Rotation of money has stopped and businessmen are not in a position to accept new orders."Jain said workers payment is major issues as the withdrawal limit from banks for current accounts are very less.
<LOC>5982d0659855b7221e182d40</LOC>: <PER>5982d0bf9855b7221e187974</PER>, a resident of Bettiah in Bihar, is a movie buff who never used to miss any movie released in his nearest film theatre.However, he has not seen a single film since November 8, because he doesn't have cash to buy the Rs 50 ticket, thanks to the sudden demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.The jury is still out on whether the government's demonetisation drive to combat black money will succeed, but the initiative seems to have created a digital divide in the cinema exhibition industry. Single screen theatres in smaller towns where there is no facility for card payment have suffered a direct blow from the note ban while multiplexes claim that their business is not hit much and is bouncing back.Most single screen owners in the country are staring at major losses with show cancellations and abysmal ticket sales. <PER>5982d1299855b7221e18ced3</PER>, who controls 35 theatres in Bihar and Jharkhand, told ET that collections are down to 15-20 per cent in his properties."At many places we have revised ticket prices  balcony from Rs 70 to Rs 40, and second class from Rs 50 to Rs 30, just to get people come to watch films. But they don't have cash, so how will they come," he said. "In big cities, you talk about credit cards and online payment; here we don't even have computerised ticketing in almost 95 per cent screens," Bairolia said.<PER>5982d1299855b7221e18cee2</PER>, who owns a small multiplex and a single screen property in Gujarat, said, "We have seen over 60 per cent drop in business. Cinema is luxury spend in areas where we operate. We will have to live with the situation till things normalise," he said.Incidentally, it's a double whammy for the single screen owners as producers are recalibrating film releases with limited prints considering the hard cash crunch across the country. <PER>5982d0c89855b7221e188086</PER>-starrer 'Dear Zindagi', for example, was released in just 1,200 screens this Friday.<ORG>5982d1299855b7221e18cee3</ORG> 2 and Befikre are working on their distribution strategy to release films in less number of screens. <PER>5982d1299855b7221e18cee0</PER>, joint managing director of digital cinema services company <ORG>5982d1299855b7221e18cedb</ORG>-Works that offers digital delivery of cinema to 330 screens in India, said for one week post the demonetisation announcement, the occupancy of single screen theatres in smaller centres had gone down to 5-7 per cent."Now it is slightly better but so far, from the logs that we have got, I can tell that more than 50 per cent shows have got cancelled because of no public," he said.<PER>5982d1299855b7221e18ced7</PER>, COO at <ORG>5982d1299855b7221e18cedc</ORG>, which operates 17 screens in smaller cities of <STA>5982d0659855b7221e182d26</STA>, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Maharashtra, said, "Our business model revolves around screens in smaller towns at affordable prices, where most of the transactions happen in cash. My occupancy has come down to 5 per cent, while operational cost remains the same. My cost of running one show is Rs 4,000 and tickets we are generating worth Rs 500-700 only."In fact, demonetisation has impacted the industry at a time when it releawas just coming out of an extremely poor second quarter, which saw a lot of films tanking at the box office."Things had just started to look better with Shivaay and Ae Dil <PER>5982d0729855b7221e183874</PER>, and this order (demonetisation) came," said <PER>5982d1299855b7221e18ced0</PER> at <ORG>5982d1299855b7221e18cedd</ORG>, which runs Mukta A2 Cinemas in 13 cities."We have seen 30-40 per cent impact on business in the last two weeks, but I hope it will be less, going forward. Our cashless transactions have improved from 8-9 per cent earlier to 14 per cent now," he said.Puri said box office collection of 'Rock On 2' has been affected at least by 50 per cent. "Same with Force 2, which would have done better in single screens, but people had no cash," he said.Interestingly, multiplex operators are not perturbed with demonetisation. <PER>5982d11e9855b7221e18c5cb</PER>, director of <ORG>5982d11e9855b7221e18c5bc</ORG>, which has partnered with <ORG>5982d0659855b7221e182dd9</ORG> to allow cash withdrawals at its 106 properties across India, said his company is completely supporting the demonetisation drive."Initially there was a slight dip in the footfalls, but that was more because people were busy in sorting out their finances," he said. But since then its cashless transactions have doubled to 70 per cent."Cash transactions have gone down but cashless have doubled. We are seeing that Indians love films and with Dear Zindagi, and things are coming back to normal," Jain said. <PER>5982d0a59855b7221e18624f</PER>, CEO at <ORG>5982d0a69855b7221e186252</ORG>, said that while first week was a bit drastic, situation is much better now."Business is bouncing back, on Saturday we registered 74 per cent occupancy. When content is good, people do spend. Plus we have also doled out a lot of incentives, including up to 35 per cent discounts and complete waiver of the convenience fee, which is helping," he said."Now 82 per cent of our transactions are cashless," Dutta added.

"The matter is now being addressed by my lawyers. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any issue that is confidential and between my partner and myself at this stage," he said.Bakshi's term as managing director expired on July 17. At the company's board meeting on August 6, the two McDonald's nominees on the four-member board rejected the proposal to re-nominate him as MD. On August 30, McDonald's India issued a public notice saying Bakshi had ceased to be the managing director of the joint venture.A person familiar with the situation said Bakshi will challenge the striking down of his reappointment on the basis of 'certain provisions of the shareholder agreement', but refused to elaborate on what these provisions were.Bakshi is expected to appeal to CLB to resolve the deadlock over the appointment of the company's MD, this person said. At present, there are two nominees of Bakshi and McDonald's on the board, and his renomination has to be ratified by the majority of the board.This person added that at the August 6 board meeting, the McDonald's nominees had ratified all the decisions taken by their Indian partner as managing director. "If he had done something wrong or had misused his position, why would they ratify his decisions?" he said.In his petition to CLB, Bakshi is also likely to say he has been unfairly treated compared with McDonald's other partner Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt Ltd.Both Connaught Plaza Restaurants and Hardcastle Restaurants had started off as equal joint ventures between McDonald's and their Indian partners when the fast-food chain entered India in 1995-96. But in 2011, the US company allowed <PER>5982d09f9855b7221e185da4</PER>, the Indian partner in Hardcastle, to buy its 50% stake at an attractive price and convert the company into a franchisee operation in the south and west. It is also understood that McDonald's agreed to reduce Hardcastle's royalty payment.Bakshi, too, wanted to convert his joint venture into a similar franchise arrangement, but McDonald's did not agree, said people familiar with the situation. He wanted a free hand, expand the business and take the company public, the way <ORG>5982d0749855b7221e183a23</ORG> did, which has now become a benchmark for all restaurant companies in India. Relations between the two partners soured when McDonald's did not accede to his request, said these people.In addition, between 2008 and 2012, Connaught Plaza Restaurants' debt was frozen at the insistence of McDonald's, which reduced the JV's ability to invest and grow. "The joint venture company had to keep its debt at less than Rs 134 crore until 2012. After much discussion on growth, the debt level was raised to Rs 161 crore," said the person quoted earlier.Now, McDonald's is asking Bakshi to exit, and the deadlock is over valuation. "The American company is unwilling to pay the price Bakshi wants," he said.Meanwhile, Hardcastle was allowed to increase its debt, and later freed from McDonald's control, enabling it to grow at a faster rate. The company now operates 166 outlets compared with Connaught Plaza Restaurants' 154.

BENGALURU : The $143-billion IT/IT-enabled services sector is going through a paradigm shift on the back of increased commoditisation of traditional services and adoption of digital technologies. And, the sector is looking up to the government for some direction to tide over the temporary turbulence.Section 35(2)(AB) should be amended to include information technology along with biotechnology so that there is a clarity that the weighted deduction would be available to an assessee engaged in production of computer software and business of information technology so that all R&D activities are enabled for weighted deduction, said P N Sudarshan, partner, <ORG>5982d0ee9855b7221e18a182</ORG>.K V <PER>5982d06a9855b7221e18312e</PER>, chief finance officer of <ORG>59899ded9855b71f847e30f2</ORG>, an IT product company, says with the <ORG>5982d0ad9855b7221e186893</ORG> getting more and more tough on visas and restrictions, things will change in the IT sector. We want a roadmap from the government on how it plans to bring down the corporate tax from 30 to 25 per cent.According to him, there should be specific guidelines for minimum alternate tax. This penal provision by the government where you need to pay taxes if you show profits in your account has gone up from 4 per cent to almost 20 per cent. So, the difference between a normal tax which is 30 per cent and a penal tax is only 10 per cent. Most IT companies in the SEZ are not taxed, but with the introduction of MAT the whole purpose of an SEZ was defeated.He believes the rules for place of effective management, which the government wanted to implement, should be looked at carefully as this will make most of the Indian IT companies having subsidiaries abroad liable to pay tax in India.<PER>598996ac9855b71f84778e2d</PER>, co-founder of <ORG>5982d1b39855b7221e193f31</ORG> and executive chairman of <ORG>59899ded9855b71f847e30ec</ORG>, pointed out that the only thing which is going to be a little difficult is GST and they need to make sure it doesnt create difficulties for the IT industry.There is also scope for double taxation, says <PER>5982d1139855b7221e18be3d</PER>. The impact of equalisation levy is on the recipient foreign company at six per cent of the consideration for services to be witheld by Indian payers. If the home country does not give credit for equalisation levy, this could lead to double taxation.

It was not a regular morning at Orchids, a beauty salon in Adyar. Policemen were at the door with sheets of paper in their hands. Even if they have left, it is fine. This is not some enquiry.

AHMEDABAD: A green hurdle seems to have hit construction activity around Thol lake. The <ORG>59899b209855b71f847bb503</ORG> (Auda), which gives clearance for development in the vicinity of the lake has issued a diktat that is likely to hinder construction activity within the 10-km radius of Thol.Auda's orders follow a state government's general resolution (GR) issued last month regarding construction activity around eco-sensitive zones.The <ORG>5982d0669855b7221e182e87</ORG> had in 2002 issued an order directing state governments to identify eco sensitive zones in their respective regions and stall all non-forest activity in these areas. As per the new resolution, all construction and development activity within the 10-km radius of an eco-sensitive zone - an animal or bird sanctuary or wetland - could be carried out only after clearance from Standing Committee of <ORG>598994f79855b71f8476433d</ORG> for Wildlife.The resolution will hit development in more than 70 villages around Thol where around Rs 30,000-crore worth of projects have been launched in the last five years."We respect the Supreme Court directives to preserve wildlife sanctuaries. But, we would like the government to simplify land acquisition and environmental clearance procedures. Else, development would suffer," says <PER>59899df89855b71f847e3b75</PER>, vice-president, <ORG>5982d0689855b7221e182ff9</ORG>' Associations of India (Credai).However, there seems to be ambiguity as to which state government agency will monitor illegal construction. When contacted senior Auda officials said that clarity on the issue will come only after consultations with concerned state government departments. The new resolution says developers who had taken permission for construction and development activity after 2008 will have to once again apply for permission with the union environment ministry.

Researchers from <ORG>5989945f9855b71f8475cd54</ORG>475cd54</MISC> London and <ORG>598995da9855b71f8476ecf2</ORG>, who conducted the study, say residents of such localities are more vulnerable to heart diseases, stroke and hypertension than people in other parts of a city.Nearly 350 flights land and take off from the airport in Chennai every day so it stands to reason that people in localities like St Thomas Mount, Adambakkam, Nanganallur, Pazhavanthangal and Tirusulam, all near the Meenambakkam airstrip, could be similarly affected.Doctors in the city say no study on the subject has been carried out in the country but admit there is enough evidence to prove that it is a problem here too. "<ORG>5989950b9855b71f84765183</ORG> (MERF) will conduct a study next year to record the noise levels near the airport, railway stations and busy markets and analyse the impact they have on residents in areas nearby," MERF founder <PER>5989a1429855b71f84814a4d</PER> said.He said the average level of noise that people can be exposed to is 80 decibels for eight hours. But noise levels in and around the airport are often between 90 and 100 decibels. Studies show that a person can put up with a sound level of 91 decibels for only two hours each day before their hearing is put at risk."Long-term exposure to the high frequency noise from aircraft could result in hearing loss or worse," Dr Kameshwaran said. "People living close to an airport are vulnerable to psychological disorders as well.""It is not just the noise from the aircraft. People have to change their entire audio environment. They end up increasing the television volume and talk loudly to be heard above the noise, putting a lot of strain on the body and mind," Dr Kameshwaran said. Cardiologist <PER>5982d1ce9855b7221e1955c9</PER> of <ORG>5982d0849855b7221e184714</ORG>5b7221e184714</PER> said sudden blasts of noise can increase the heart rate, leading to sleep disorders. "Constant exposure to loud noise causes a rise in blood pressure, leading to cardiovascular problems," he said.
CHENNAI: <PER>598998349855b71f84790aa9</PER>, 24, a post-graduate student of social work at <MISC>5989954d9855b71f847684bc</MISC>684bc</ORG>, <PER>59899bec9855b71f847c615b</PER>, died of rabies early on Friday. He was bitten by a rabid pup on the college campus in November 2013. Alan was a dog lover.In November 2013, he and his classmates were walking to their department when they came across the pup. He and a classmate played with the pup, which bit them both. Alan and his friend went to general physicians to get treated. "The girl's physician recommended that she take the anti-rabies vaccine, but Alan's doctor seems to have said a tetanus toxoid shot would suffice," said <PER>5989a23d9855b71f848230da</PER>, public relations officer of <ORG>598994a69855b71f84760458</ORG> Vellore, who confirmed that Alan died at the hospital at 1am on Friday.A post by MCC's department of social welfare on a social networking site on February 13 said Alan complained of shoulder pain after two days, and his parents took him to a doctor close to their home. The doctor informed them that Alan was displaying symptoms of advanced stage of rabies and told them to take him to a government hospital.At GH he was referred to CMC, Vellore. "He hasn't slept the whole night, refused to lie down, just kept sitting and staring at everyone. He's showing aversion to breeze and water. Please pray for a miracle," the post read.On February 17, an update on the site said doctors at CMC had put him under induced coma and were waiting for his immune system to produce antibodies. Jasper said that as soon as he was diagnosed with rabies, the doctors told his parents that he may not survive. "There are only six known cases of survival across the world. We tried on the patient the <LOC>59899cc59855b71f847d2a4a</LOC> protocol, which saved these people in the US, but it didn't help," said <PER>5982d0e89855b7221e189bc9</PER> of CMC. The hospital is treating Samuel's friend who was also bitten, since she had taken only three of the five doses of anti-rabies shots.The college has a 365-acre campus many parts of which remain unexplored or unfrequented by students and faculty. Students and faculty said the dog population had grown on the campus.Principal R W <PER>598998349855b71f84790aab</PER> said the management had tried to prevent the dogs from entering the campus by building compound walls at vulnerable areas. "We try to curb the dogs from proliferating without doing ecological damage, but it's always been a problem. We regularly inform the local authorities and the Blue Cross who try to catch the dogs to prevent the population from growing. But, the moment the dogs sense this, they hide in the bushes. It's not possible for the authorities to camp here for days to catch them," Jesudasan said.He said the authorities have recommended that all students take the anti-rabies vaccine. to be on the safe side. "Alan was an engineering student who joined the course to be able to serve society. He was a pet lover, and was used to dogs, so he didn't take the bite too seriously. Our class is small, so we were very close to each other," said R Akhilesh, a classmate. Alan's funeral will be held at <ORG>5982d08b9855b7221e184c80</ORG> in Vepery on Sunday.

<LOC>5982d0659855b7221e182d40</LOC>: Men who invariably pinch some of women's personal care products are a given. But when it comes to the olfactory nerve-sensitizing deodorant category, men are strongly exercising their choice. As a result, the male segment in the deodorant category has overtaken the female segment with a significant lead.In most personal care categories commonly used in households, the male usership is restricted to brands that women choose to purchase. Whether it is soaps, shampoos, talcs, skin creams and moisturizers - male members of a household continue to make use of the products targeted largely at women.While male grooming in India has largely been associated with shaving products, the BO-busting deodorant market, which was considered nascent a few years ago, has grown largely because of male patronage. Of the Rs 1,400-crore deodorant market, the male segment is of the order of Rs 1,000 crore, which pegs the male-to-female segment ratio at 70:30.In other categories - face wash, face cream or fairness - the female segments are predominant, with men acting as surrogate users. The reason why deodorants have brought more male consumers into its fold has a lot to do with the nature of activity undertaken by men and women, with men tending to require deodorants more often.Interestingly, however, it appears that a section of women may also be using male deodorants, spurring the growth in this segment, said industry experts."The specific insight into the deodorant market is that some women prefer to use male products, which are considered to be stronger deodorants as compared to female deodorants. In some of the categories, the usage is restricted to individual usage when it comes into a household. However, in deodorants, we have seen multiple family members using the same perfume.

Men, on the other hand, were not very used to perfumes and the advent of deodorants gave them a convenient and legitimate tool to manage their fragrance issues."It is pertinent to clarify that while both these segments are growing at a rapid pace, the female deodorants' segment is growing at a faster clip albeit on a small base," said <PER>5989a6b39855b71f84865029</PER>, category head (deodorants), Hindustan <ORG>5982d1239855b7221e18ca61</ORG>, which has added <PER>5989a6b39855b71f8486502c</PER> deodorants to its portfolio targeting women.The male grooming market has gradually expanded into categories such as soaps, talc, skin creams and even face wash. While it strives to grow in each of these categories, in some large categories such as soaps, it forms merely Rs 300-400 crore in the total category of Rs 10,000 crore."At an overall level, the 'women's' market is still expected to be far bigger than the 'men's' market as their needs are more clearly defined and traditionally it goes that way.

<LOC>598994619855b71f8475cf27</LOC>: IT and technology firms are taking longer to fill corner room vacancies. Senior management positions are taking up to 6-8 months to be filled, a sign that business is slowing down and managements are not in a hurry to fill vacancies. In good times, vacancies get filled in 2-3 months.The long gestation is also indicative of growing wariness among senior execs to switch jobs, a phenomenon visible in times of economic slowdown. People see their current employers, where they would have worked for a while and built relationships, as safer places to be. This also means companies that are looking to fill positions have fewer candidates on offer.C K <PER>5982d0849855b7221e18479d</PER>, search consultant for the technology practice at global executive search firm <ORG>5989a4289855b71f8483f7fd</ORG>, says companies need business justification for filling up senior-level positions. "The fragile economic scenario has forced companies to delay closures. Some vacancies have extended beyond six months," he says.<PER>5989a7279855b71f8486bd80</PER>, executive VP at global search firm <ORG>5989a05c9855b71f84807309</ORG>, echoes that: "Companies are being more prudent in the current economic scenario. There is no frenzy to fill positions."Vacancies for director level positions (senior VP roles) in <ORG>5982d2df9855b7221e1a4240</ORG>, <ORG>5982d07a9855b7221e183e80</ORG> and <ORG>5982d2b79855b7221e1a1be5</ORG> in India are said to have been open for a fairly long time, which in the normal course would have been closed in less than 4 months. However, hiring for senior execs is seen to be relatively brisk for technologies like cloud, analytics and mobility, the hot new areas where a lot of attention is now focused."The quarter-on-quarter numbers have not been healthy and there is pressure on companies to cut costs. They would rather focus on expanding their margins than adding to costs," says <PER>5989a7279855b71f8486bd7a</PER>, partner at executive search firm <ORG>5989a7279855b71f8486bd77</ORG>. He adds that companies are also more frequently revisiting earlier assumptions about the kind of person they need, making changes when the search process was underway, thus delaying the process. This is perhaps reflective of the growing uncertainties that businesses today face. A sector analyst said that an Indian IT company that was looking out for a global vertical business head suddenly changed the specs, restricting the job to North America, when the candidates' list was presented to the client.<PER>5989a31b9855b71f8482fc3d</PER>, vice-president at executive search firm <ORG>5989a1899855b71f84818d31</ORG>, says there's also temptation now to look within. "Companies are pushing up talent available within the company to occupy executive roles rather than look at lateral hires. They, however, benchmark internal candidates with others who have been short-listed." Lateral hires are invariably more expensive than internal candidates.<PER>5989a7279855b71f8486bd7f</PER>, senior partner - technology and telecom practice at executive search firm <ORG>5982d1139855b7221e18be38</ORG>, says that for some positions, the search takes longer because there isn't enough talent available in the country. "Companies often want candidates for leadership roles to demonstrate business acumen and hands-on technology experience. That may not be easy to find," she says.

These include the Goods & Services Tax (GST), clearance for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), relaxation of foreign investment norms and the implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) that are all expected to augur well for the sector in the coming year, according to analysts and developers.RERA, GST, REITs and the latest demonetisation drive will bring in transparency in the sector and will boost the confidence of consumers, developers and investors in 2017 and coming years, said Anshuman Magazine, Chairman India and South East Asia at the international real estate services firm <ORG>5982d1389855b7221e18daf4</ORG>While demonetisation would help enhance transparency and pave the way for increased global institutional capital, a timely implementation of GST would help address ambiguities around taxation and benefit sectors such as warehousing, Mr. Magazine said.Despite several positive policy initiatives, a few issues, however, still continue to act as a deterrent to the sectors growth, he said.Capital inflowsCapital inflows are still low due to banks remaining wary of investing in real estate, Mr. Magazine said. From a policy perspective, ambiguity in land acquisition laws and state specific RERA laws and its implementation are slowing down development of the real estate market, he said.All this aside, India will continue to retain its position as a bright spot in the global economy, with better growth prospects expected to support commercial space leasing in 2017, Mr. Magazine said.Cash crunchHowever, with global disruptions and the cash crunch that had ensued in the wake of demonetisation impacting the real estate sector, the year 2017 was headed for a subdued beginning, according to industry observers.With enquiries, walk-ins and sales drying up as a fall-out of demonetisation, the first two quarters of the coming year were likely to witness a substantial slowdown in sales, said <PER>5982d1ad9855b7221e1938ff</PER>, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), <ORG>5982d0659855b7221e182dce</ORG>. Ltd.In the first half of 2017, the sector is expected to be largely muted and there would be pressure on prices. With consumers in a wait and watch mode, demand could be subdued due to a mindset that property prices could undergo reduction along with a substantial lowering of home loan interest rates, Mr. Baijal said.The office market is expected to face challenges to maintain the prevailing pace of growth in the coming year. This could be due to the geopolitical risk of a probable reduction in outsourcing from the U.S., structural changes in the domestic economy and top technology companies reducing their growth targets, Mr. Baijal said.On the positive side, the implementation of RERA by May 2017 coupled with legislations like the GST bill and Benami Act would further increase transparency and reliability within the sector. This will also see a boost in institutional funds flowing into the sector at competitive rates which will enable the sector to come out of the woods, Mr. Baijal said.Ideal yearReal estate developer <PER>5982d1ad9855b7221e193905</PER>, CMD, House of Hiranandani said 2017 would be an ideal year to buy a house as borrowing rates would taper given the huge influx of money into the banking system post demonetisation. This can set off a cycle, wherein lower rates of interest will prompt borrowers to avail more loans at attractive interest rates, he said.Mr. Hiranandani said home buyers could now get good deals in the market as the industry had just begun to adjust to the new rules. This holds true especially for the first quarter of the year as most developers will look to sell existing inventory, so consumers should make the most of this opportunity and purchase property at attractive prices, he said.The approval process, however, still remained a major impediment to real estate development, according to him.While the government has done a lot to ease the functioning of the real estate sector and protect the consumers, it must get the statutory authorities responsible for clearing the projects within the purview of law. Administrative reforms should be made to facilitate quicker approval process which will help developers complete and handover projects on time, Mr. Hiranandani said.Promising potentialBrotin <PER>5982d1179855b7221e18c0f1</PER>, Managing Director and CEO of <ORG>5982d1ad9855b7221e1938fc</ORG> said the long-term potential of the industry looks promising and the policy changes had set the base for developers to capitalise on.However, the industry will get a boost when it is granted crucial infrastructural and economic necessities from the government.

Changing foreign currency to Indian rupees is still an issue for many tourists, who have also been unable to exchange the demonetised notes.Indiran, a visitor from Malaysia, who had come down to shop for a wedding in the family and visit temples in Manthralayam and Tirupati, said as far as stay was concerned, there was no problem since they could pay by card. But it is a problem when one has to pay for the taxi or buy puja items for the temples. I had to borrow some cash from a few friends in Chennai, he said.Some hoteliers said they were still accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes from customers who were unable to change them. For the first few days, there was no cash with money changers, so we had to help them. They are not able to change for more than Rs. 5,000, given the ceiling on exchange. That is hardly enough for the kind of spending that many of them like to do when they are here, a city hotelier said.In some places where banks and forex counters were not helping tourists, they were forced to approach touts to get their notes exchanged, a travel operator said.<PER>5982d1e19855b7221e19670b</PER>, secretary general, All <ORG>5982d1e19855b7221e19670a</ORG>, said in the first few days, there was a problem of currency not being available in money exchange counters.We directed the consumers to the banks that had money. But the situation has eased since we have been allowed to draw from banks. There is no doubt that there are hitches still, but we have asked our members to interact with banks and help our customers, he said.

<LOC>5982d0659855b7221e182d40</LOC>, Nov. 10: The Tatas removed <PER>5982d0919855b7221e18525b</PER>, the former chairman of the Tata group, from the position of chairman of <ORG>5982d09b9855b7221e185a85</ORG> today and accused him of orchestrating efforts to "take control of main operating companies of the Tata group to the exclusion of <ORG>5982d07b9855b7221e183f82</ORG> and other Tata representatives". Tata Sons is the holding company for the $103-billion group and holds a 73.26 per cent stake in TCS, the $16.5-billion software giant. This is the first operational group company from which Mistry is being removed after being dismissed as chairman of Tata Sons on October 24. Bombay House also announced plans to call extraordinary general meetings of TCS and <ORG>5982d2579855b7221e19c97f</ORG> to seek shareholders' approval to remove him from the board of directors of the two companies. "It was fair expectation that Mr Mistry would gracefully resign from the boards of other Tata companies on being replaced from the position of chairman of Tata Sons. This expectation was in line with convention, past practice, as well as Tata governance guidelines that were approved and adopted by Tata Sons under the aegis of Mr Mistry," the Tatas said in a nine-page note placed in the public domain. In a filing with the stock exchanges, TCS said <PER>5982d07f9855b7221e184312</PER>, an old and trusted Tata executive, would replace Mistry as interim chairman till a new incumbent is found. Hussain had chosen to abstain when the directors of Tata Sons voted out Mistry at the October 24 meeting after expressing a lack of faith in his leadership. The move to remove Mistry from the board of Indian Hotels comes after independent directors came out in strong support of his leadership of the loss-making company at a board meeting on November 4. The Tata group's stake in Indian Hotels is 38.65 per cent, which means it will need support from institutional investors at the shareholders' meeting to remove Mistry. The Tatas claimed the right to remove Mistry from the chairman's post at TCS on the strength of Article 90 of the Articles of Association of the company that confers on Tata Sons the right to nominate the chairman of the board of directors as long as it holds at least 26 per cent of the paid-up equity share capital of the company. The sudden and precipitate action against Mistry, who has fallen out of favour with the Tata group headed by interim chairman Ratan Tata, signals the group's resolve to finally slam the doors on the former chairman whose family owns an 18.4 per cent stake in Tata Sons. However, independent directors continue to frustrate the Tata group's efforts to force Mistry out. Today, independent directors of <ORG>5982d0719855b7221e183733</ORG> "unanimously affirmed their confidence in the board, its chairman and the management in the conduct of the company's business". Under provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, TCS and Indian Hotels can call shareholders' meetings within 21 days and hold them within 45 days of the requisition. Corporate governance experts said a simple majority of the shareholders voting in favour of the resolution would seal Mistry's fate. Reports suggest that the move to replace Mistry as chairman of TCS had been brewing for some time and a final decision was taken at a late-night huddle on Wednesday between Ratan Tata and key advisers. In the note, the Tata group accused Mistry of trying to subvert the traditional structures within the group to grab control of the main operating companies within the group. It said Mistry had adopted a "clever strategy planned and systematically achieved over the last four years" of placing himself as the only Tata Sons' representative on the boards of the operating companies. The note added: "Tata Sons has historically exercised control over its group companies through its shareholding and commonality of senior directors... which had acted as a binding force in the group for many years." "We now have an unacceptable new structure where the (Tata Sons) chairman alone is the only common director across several companies and this situation could not be allowed to go on," the note said. The group accused Mistry of trying to gain control of Indian Hotels "with the support of the independent directors of the board". The note said Mistry had carefully planned a strategy to "frustrate Tata Sons' ability to exercise influence and control on IHCL". The group also slammed Mistry's performance over the past four years and charged him with cranking up the group's borrowings from Rs 155,863 crore in March 2012 to Rs 225,740 crore, and trying to tarnish the image of Ratan Tata and running down the latter's legacy by highlighting only the problems of the so-called "hotspots" - <ORG>5982d0719855b7221e183732</ORG>, <ORG>5982d0b49855b7221e186efc</ORG> and the Indian operations of <ORG>5982d1109855b7221e18bc7a</ORG> - without trying to conceive a solution to the problem. Mistry's office issued a terse note to rebut the fresh charges. It said the Tata Sons' media release had used "selective data, unsubstantiated claims and half truths without a word of explanation as to why it became necessary to remove him summarily violating natural justice and without explanation". "The Tata Sons statement reflects desperation. All the reasons... should have been recorded in the minutes of the many Tata Sons board meetings held over four years of Mr Mistry's chairmanship.... Unfortunately for them, no such record exists," the note added.

<LOC>5982d0659855b7221e182d40</LOC>, Nov. 13: The Tata-<PER>5982d0919855b7221e18525b</PER> row flared up today with the ousted chairman hitting back at attempts to question the integrity of the independent directors who backed him, prompting the $103-billion group's holding company <ORG>5982d07b9855b7221e183f82</ORG> to assert that it will do "whatever is required" to deal with the situation. A new note issued by Cyrus Mistry's office late in the evening today slammed Tata Sons' attempt to tarnish the image of the independent directors on the boards of Indian Hotels and <ORG>5982d0719855b7221e183733</ORG> by suggesting that there was an ulterior motive to back Mistry. The Mistry camp in the note said six of the nine independent directors on the boards of the two companies - <PER>5982d0879855b7221e1848bb</PER>, <PER>5982d2669855b7221e19d563</PER>, <PER>5982d2679855b7221e19d56f</PER>, <PER>5982d2679855b7221e19d56e</PER>, <PER>5982d0919855b7221e185263</PER>, and <PER>5982d2679855b7221e19d56b</PER> - had been appointed during Ratan Tata's regime as chairman of the group, which ended in December 2012. Two of these directors (Keki Dadiseth and Nasser Munjee) also serve as trustees of the Tata Trusts. Meanwhile, hardening its stand, Tata Sons today said its management would do whatever was required to deal with the situation arising out of the ouster of Mistry and wanted its independent directors to ensure the future of <PER>5982d2679855b7221e19d571</PER> companies and the interest of all stakeholders was protected. In a statement released after Mistry's note, Tata Sons said on November 10, 2016, it had already put forward facts so that the decision of the Tata Sons board "to replace <PER>5982d0919855b7221e18525b</PER> as chairman is seen in the desired perspective". "The Tata Sons management will do whatever is required to deal with the situation," it said. Last week, in a nine-page note, the Tatas had accused Mistry of orchestrating efforts to "take control of the main operating companies of <ORG>5982d0719855b7221e183731</ORG> to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives". The Tata note had said Mistry had adopted a "clever strategy planned and systematically achieved over the last four years" of placing himself as the only Tata Sons' representative on the boards of the operating companies. According to the note released by Mistry's office today, the unequivocal endorsement given by the independent directors in at least two listed companies was a "reflection of Mistry's conduct as chairman in upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and in taking the board along in all decisions that impact the company''. It added that it was truly unfortunate that Tata Sons had chosen to question the independence of these nine directors "given that the country acknowledges them as stalwarts of <ORG>5982d06a9855b7221e1831ae</ORG>". The Mistry camp also dismissed the Tata claim that the former chairman had created a governance structure where the operating companies had started "drifting away". According to the note, before Mistry assumed the role of the chairman of Tata Sons, all of its board members (excluding him) were internal to the group, being either vice-chairmen of group companies or members of the group corporate centre (GCC). The GCC was an internal panel earlier set up by Tata Group and it was to provide strategic and operational support to the chairman. After Mistry took over, he formed a group executive council (<ORG>5982d2669855b7221e19d566</ORG>), which assumed the role of the GCC and the group executive office. Mistry added that the structure has now changed drastically because of the regulations. The note pointed out that the requirement to have 30 per cent trust nominees and 30 per cent independent directors meant that in addition to <PER>5982d07f9855b7221e184312</PER> and Mistry, there was possibly only one more senior group centre member who could be on the board of Tata Sons. This limited the involvement of other group centre members on the Tata Sons board. Moreover, in the past three years, all these internal members, with the exception of Ishaat Hussain, have retired. The note further mentioned that as agreed with the Tata Sons board, the governance mechanism to protect Tata Sons' interests and ensure adequate group representation on operating company boards, was to have GEC members and other senior group centre members of the likes of Farokh Subedar and S. Padmanabhan and select CEOs (like <PER>5982d14a9855b7221e18e9f9</PER>, Noel Tata) on the boards of operating companies.

<LOC>5982d0659855b7221e182d40</LOC>, Nov. 13: The Tata-<PER>5982d0919855b7221e18525b</PER> row flared up today with the ousted chairman hitting back at attempts to question the integrity of the independent directors who backed him, prompting the $103-billion group's holding company <ORG>5982d07b9855b7221e183f82</ORG> to assert that it will do "whatever is required" to deal with the situation. A new note issued by Cyrus Mistry's office late in the evening today slammed Tata Sons' attempt to tarnish the image of the independent directors on the boards of Indian Hotels and <ORG>5982d0719855b7221e183733</ORG> by suggesting that there was an ulterior motive to back Mistry. The Mistry camp in the note said six of the nine independent directors on the boards of the two companies - <PER>5982d0879855b7221e1848bb</PER>, <PER>5982d2669855b7221e19d563</PER>, <PER>5982d2679855b7221e19d56f</PER>, <PER>5982d2679855b7221e19d56e</PER>, <PER>5982d0919855b7221e185263</PER>, and <PER>5982d2679855b7221e19d56b</PER> - had been appointed during Ratan Tata's regime as chairman of the group, which ended in December 2012. Two of these directors (Keki Dadiseth and Nasser Munjee) also serve as trustees of the Tata Trusts. Meanwhile, hardening its stand, Tata Sons today said its management would do whatever was required to deal with the situation arising out of the ouster of Mistry and wanted its independent directors to ensure the future of <PER>5982d2679855b7221e19d571</PER> companies and the interest of all stakeholders was protected. In a statement released after Mistry's note, Tata Sons said on November 10, 2016, it had already put forward facts so that the decision of the Tata Sons board "to replace <PER>5982d0919855b7221e18525b</PER> as chairman is seen in the desired perspective". "The Tata Sons management will do whatever is required to deal with the situation," it said. Last week, in a nine-page note, the Tatas had accused Mistry of orchestrating efforts to "take control of the main operating companies of <ORG>5982d0719855b7221e183731</ORG> to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives". The Tata note had said Mistry had adopted a "clever strategy planned and systematically achieved over the last four years" of placing himself as the only Tata Sons' representative on the boards of the operating companies. According to the note released by Mistry's office today, the unequivocal endorsement given by the independent directors in at least two listed companies was a "reflection of Mistry's conduct as chairman in upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and in taking the board along in all decisions that impact the company''. It added that it was truly unfortunate that Tata Sons had chosen to question the independence of these nine directors "given that the country acknowledges them as stalwarts of <ORG>5982d06a9855b7221e1831ae</ORG>". The Mistry camp also dismissed the Tata claim that the former chairman had created a governance structure where the operating companies had started "drifting away". According to the note, before Mistry assumed the role of the chairman of Tata Sons, all of its board members (excluding him) were internal to the group, being either vice-chairmen of group companies or members of the group corporate centre (GCC). The GCC was an internal panel earlier set up by Tata Group and it was to provide strategic and operational support to the chairman.

Concrete prospects:The Real Estate Regulation Act, GST and demonetisation will bring in transparency in the sector and boost consumer confidence, industry officials say. FILE PHOTOThe year 2016 was significant for the real estate sector due to the number of reforms that were initiated in the period. These include the Goods & Services Tax (GST), clearance for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), relaxation of foreign investment norms and the implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) that are all expected to augur well for the sector in the coming year, according to analysts and developers.RERA, GST, REITs and the latest demonetisation drive will bring in transparency in the sector and will boost the confidence of consumers, developers and investors in 2017 and coming years, said Anshuman Magazine, Chairman India and South East Asia at the international real estate services firm <ORG>5982d1389855b7221e18daf4</ORG>While demonetisation would help enhance transparency and pave the way for increased global institutional capital, a timely implementation of GST would help address ambiguities around taxation and benefit sectors such as warehousing, Mr. Magazine said.Despite several positive policy initiatives, a few issues, however, still continue to act as a deterrent to the sectors growth, he said.Capital inflowsCapital inflows are still low due to banks remaining wary of investing in real estate, Mr. Magazine said. From a policy perspective, ambiguity in land acquisition laws and state specific RERA laws and its implementation are slowing down development of the real estate market, he said.All this aside, India will continue to retain its position as a bright spot in the global economy, with better growth prospects expected to support commercial space leasing in 2017, Mr. Magazine said.Cash crunchHowever, with global disruptions and the cash crunch that had ensued in the wake of demonetisation impacting the real estate sector, the year 2017 was headed for a subdued beginning, according to industry observers.With enquiries, walk-ins and sales drying up as a fall-out of demonetisation, the first two quarters of the coming year were likely to witness a substantial slowdown in sales, said <PER>5982d1ad9855b7221e1938ff</PER>, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), <ORG>5982d0659855b7221e182dce</ORG>.

This could be due to the geopolitical risk of a probable reduction in outsourcing from the U.S., structural changes in the domestic economy and top technology companies reducing their growth targets, Mr. Baijal said.On the positive side, the implementation of RERA by May 2017 coupled with legislations like the GST bill and Benami Act would further increase transparency and reliability within the sector.

This can set off a cycle, wherein lower rates of interest will prompt borrowers to avail more loans at attractive interest rates, he said.Mr. Hiranandani said home buyers could now get good deals in the market as the industry had just begun to adjust to the new rules. This holds true especially for the first quarter of the year as most developers will look to sell existing inventory, so consumers should make the most of this opportunity and purchase property at attractive prices, he said.The approval process, however, still remained a major impediment to real estate development, according to him.While the government has done a lot to ease the functioning of the real estate sector and protect the consumers, it must get the statutory authorities responsible for clearing the projects within the purview of law.

BENGALURU: Fear gripped the real estate market in Bengaluru on Wednesday after the governments decision to demonetise `500 and `1,000 notes.<PER>5982d2b09855b7221e1a15fb</PER> from Honey Properties said, It looks like the real estate industry will be hit for at least a year. The genuine sellers and buyers have no problem but since 70 per cent of the money in real estate is black money, the number of buyers will significantly reduce and this will bring down the real estate prices. If a person receives black money, he will invest that illegally. This vicious circle continues. The government too is at fault. They have not conducted right checks. People pay the register fees as per the government valuation and they save the remaining money.Many believe it is the mid income level people who will suffer.

BENGALURU: Fear gripped the real estate market in Bengaluru on Wednesday after the governments decision to demonetise `500 and `1,000 notes.<PER>5982d2b09855b7221e1a15fb</PER> from Honey Properties said, It looks like the real estate industry will be hit for at least a year. The genuine sellers and buyers have no problem but since 70 per cent of the money in real estate is black money, the number of buyers will significantly reduce and this will bring down the real estate prices. If a person receives black money, he will invest that illegally. This vicious circle continues. The government too is at fault. They have not conducted right checks. People pay the register fees as per the government valuation and they save the remaining money.Many believe it is the mid income level people who will suffer.
